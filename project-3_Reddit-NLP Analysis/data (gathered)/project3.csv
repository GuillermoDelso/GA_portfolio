I know she's going through a lot of stuff, but lately she hasn't been asking anything about me, she just vents about her problems but doesn't ask anything about me. I don't really know if she cares about me or not the way I do, and if she just uses me as a therapist. What am I supposed to do?",1

85,Long Distance Friendship troubles,"# Summary

A good friend of mine got mad at me and blocked me. I miss her. I want to make things right.


# What Happened?

I was helping my friend on her story. I mainly fixed common mistakes and would sometimes give my ideas on how the story should go. 

We would read the story on Facetime as it developed to spot mistakes and do silly voices for the characters. It was fun, I enjoyed it and I think she did as well.

Early September, she Facetime'd me and wanted to read the story again. I laughed at one part. I think she took it the wrong way and she ended the call. I called her back and she didn't answer. She texts me saying she'll call that evening.

So I wait, then I get a text from her. She said that she's mad that I laughed at her story. I tell her I just didn't expect the story to turn out like that. And she said I was lying. I didn't know what else to do at that point. It ended with her insulting me. 

The next day she texs me that we should take a break until December. I think I did the right thing. I just tried to play it cool and let her do her own thing. I didn't beg and just gave her time.

Last week, I noticed that she blocked me on Messenger. Now I feel terrible.

# I want to make things right

I didn't expect for her to take it this far. I feel terrible about it and want to make it right. I miss her so much and I don't want to lose her friendship.

I recalled that she wanted a few books from me on April. She gave me her address so that I could send it over. 

I want to send her the books, and write her a letter of how sorry I am, and that I miss her. Is this a good idea?",1
943,"Horrible work situation, dont know how to proceed.","I posted this recently but received little response so I will write a shorter version, see if that helps.

 This story does have a bizzare twist worth hanging in for.

So I am in high tech, started a new job 5 weeks ago at a fast growing startup and it's been pure hell, the company is great, the people are great except for the two other coworkers in my small team. 

The tech lead (not manager) Bob has been there for quite some time, they love him because he is such a perfectionist and he.has all systems memorized to every detail. He gave the most cursory training imaginable, it was sink or swim, he would say ""ask me questions"" and when I did he would say things like "" I told you that"" or ""your senior you should know that"" finally I went to a business user and spent 30 min filling in gaps that Bob never mentioned.

He also had very specific ideas as to what coworkers, senior people like me should know and understand which he never communicated in the interview so every single fucking day I hear how I should know this, should know that, every thing he sees as a mistake no matter how small is the end of world.
He started getting down right abusive, yelling at me, berating me etc.but I shut up and took it because i had only been there 2 weeks.

The other guy Joe  who started at least a month before me is a contractor who has been hustling hard to be beat me so he could keep his job. Its resulted in shabby work which seems to be ok with Bob.

The whole thing is very dysfunctional and without getting into details about Bob I talked to my manager. I focused on my challenges and what his expectations are. It was great, good manager but had so many people.to manage he is largely hands off. He did end up saying that BOB has no people skills.  He picked up on things, he hung out around our group and then called the 3 of us into a meeting and told us that we are  dysfunctional we are not working together etc he didnt blame anyone and we all agreed to work together, hatched a plan.

It was going well for a week, BoB made a noticable friendlier change (I think the manager coached him) I even mentioned this to my boss.

But I was being totally scammed, it blew my mind.
I got onto a public terminal (every one in my dept uses it constantly throughout the day, my point is that it is in no way private like our laptops) I logged in,.opened a messaging program and Bob had no logged out of it, I was going to close it when I   caught my name.
So i read it, this was an ongoing chat between Bob and Joe over the past few weeks. Almost all of the conversations were about me and their efforts to discredit me and have Bob score points to keep his job. Joe fed almost every interaction, every question I had back to Bob in a different screwed up incompetent way to discredit me. They mocked and laughed at me.at every turn. It's not too often your suspicions that sound like ""he said, she said"" like we are squabbling teenagers or that I am paranoid etc are actually vindicated.

I was going to actually sit on this, if I take it to HR they could just fire me because they love Bob. Despite taking great pride in their ego less, team work culture Bob is likely more valuable to the company.

I might normally resign but I am in dire financial straights, so I was going to just hang in as long as possible until I get fired (in their conversations Bob said they were giving me another month before they fire me according to the manager) 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1
832,Just moved to a new city and I'm depressed,"I've been living with my parents for the past 2 years (I'm 25). I knew that it was time to move on, live on my own and start being an adult, so 2 weeks ago I moved to a new city just 4 hours away. I've been in my new house for 2 weeks, I have friendly roommates, a few old friends close to me, and already have 3 job interviews lined up. Why am I so miserable?

It's been harder and harder for me to get out of bed, I'm barely eating, and everything just seems so much harder here. I don't know why, but everything that I thought would bring me such satisfaction just.... isn't. People are nice to me here and inviting me out places, but I just don't want to go. I really don't understand what's wrong with me and it's freaking me out a bit. 

Maybe it's just the change in location, but I feel like I should be used to it by now. A part of me wants to run back to my hometown (pathetic, I know), but I know I need to face adulthood and stop being a baby.

666,Conflicted to join back,"I was in a small knit gaming community discord (like 15 active members but 100 in the discord) I was in it since the first 1-2 months until last month.

(I called some girls a queen and apparently that's inappropriate, I was motivational and everyone was fine with it) The shit talk got real intense and I left because her and some other member kept talking bs about me and I didn't want to be there whilst that was always in the back of my mind.

743,How to be a person?,"How do I make a life comeback?

I (33 f) did an AMA many years ago when your average Joe Blow could contribute anything and I surprisingly got a bit of interest, for those interested (apparently the ama was deleted so I’ll copy/paste what I have at the bottom 
 The piece was a manic written deluge of thoughts on my life growing up in the Australian bush with no electricity, neighbours and mentally ill parents. To my sursprise, many redditors were intrigued with my story, I even had numerous people offer to help me write a book. Little did I know, that reddit AMA was the first tangible piece of evidence for my oncoming Bipolar Disorder diagnosis. I was up for 2 days writing the AMA and answering questions before ghosting uni, seeking out a psychiatrist and starting my journey to wellness.

And here I am. Back to reddit, this time asking for your life experiences and advice on how to build a good life and tell me it’s never to late!
Where I am at now: 
•	Enagaged to supporting, loving and kindest man I know
•	I have a rescue dog that we adore
•	I  have owned , operated and sold at a profit a hospitality business that allowed me to go back to uni after a 3 year deferral (I have no financial worries in the next year)
•	I have just dropped out of/ deferred a really prestigious biomedical degree that I was lucky to have even been selected for. I have no confidence in my ability to complete the course work 
•	All my friends have gone back to their home countries and I haven’t made any new ones in about 3 years.
•	I don’t have any formal qualifications but I need to fit in with the highly successful people my fiancé surrounds himself with and become a doctor or an ‘insert other prestigious job title’
	
Where I want to be
•	Make friends again
•	Increase my mental strength/ discipline/ self esteem etc
•	Build confidence to be able to get into my degree and complete it/ something similar
•	Run a half then a full marathon
•	Have a hobby I stick with
•	Join MMA
•	Learn maths from the bottom up. I was doing high level maths but had so many holes in it from my high school days that it really held me back. 
•	Learn Spanish


As I have stopped uni for the moment I have the opportunity to become a healthier, more confident and happier person but I don’t know where to start or how. To make things more difficult I have type 2 Bipolar disorder (confirmed) and possible ADHD diagnosis upcoming and possible PTSD issues. A great difficulty coming from the bipolar is the cognitive decline; memory loss, slow word retrieval, foggy thinking, emotional disregulation (if anyone has just read that article on procrastintion and emotional regulation this would give some insight into the reason my brain hates me).

744,Am I the bad one?,So I’ve posted before about my crappy roommates. But they had no interest in contributing to any community items for the house. No couches no table no pots or pans. They don’t even share toilet paper rolls. I’ve been saving up to purchase those things myself cuz paying for rent and other bills is hard. I barely have anything extra. But I did it after a couple of months of having nothing. An empty apartment except for 2 stools to sit on I bought a nice table and living room set. Yay for me. So my roommates gf has been buying things to decorate my table. And I’ve been removing them cuz I don’t want anything on the table. I like a clean no clutter look. I remove everything. They put their excess trash and groceries that they never put away I take it all off including the decorations. I was talking about it to someone and they told me I shouldn’t complain about them using a community item in a common room. And that if it was so much of a big deal then I shouldn’t have bought it. But what was I supposed to do? Just continue to eat on the floor in an empty apartment? Now I feel like I’m the bad guy for removing their stuff off. Should I not have bought it? They don’t ask me at all to decorate it. Why is it always falling on my shoulders to initiate a conversation with them? Idk this person made me second guess things,1

25,Its stupid but its all I’m thinking about,"I really liked this girl (lets call her A) through a whole school year and my mates always teased but tried convincing me that she liked me so I started talking to her throughout the summer.
Texts got more and more risky on my half but she wasnt complaining. 
She sent me pictures of herself to me and pictures of her with me and she would jokingly say “I love you” a lot. I never tried anything mainly because there was always a doubt she was into me.
New school year starts in a new school and A ends up going there (she literally got the exact same grades as me - not important just crazy) but we arent in the same classes.

Obviously in a new school, it was weird trying to make new friends and I was really just trying to stay focused on work. Until a girl (lets call her X) sat in front of me and asked me a question and we started talking. We start texting about school work until it gets more and more social - during this time both my crush and X started becoming really good friends. 
I saw that if I only chat to X I wouldnt want to be an asshole and forget A. And then I wouldnt want to be seen as a “pig trying to pull two girls” (verbatim from my mate).
Im pretty sure they started talking about me because A made a joke about me trying something with X. 
Then suddenly any conversation I had with A suddenly became super blunt and she would really take hours reply to any texts.
Even besides all the feelings we were good friends and I dont want to make anything worse.
X is super cool and all but after all this stuff with A I dont want to repeat this shit.
Whats the deal with this?
Im just exhausted with this messing with my head but why do I still have feelings for A?
If i wanna be a good friend to both A and X should I just leave it?
How do I clear my head and sort this out for all of us?

542,How to focus on homework/keeping up with things?,"Okay, I’ve had this problem for a long time now and I really want to fix it. 

It mostly started in 6th grade. Before, I went to after school care, which is a program that allows parents who can’t pick up their child right away hang out for the most part. I would get my homework done during the recess portion because I got bored of playing the same games everyday and I like talking more than running around and such. Once I stopped going, I didn’t have a reason to get my homework done right away anymore. This, along with some other things that happened in 6th grade, caused me to fall behind on homework. 

Now that I’m in eighth grade, this problem is creeping up on me again. At the beginning of the year, I was doing pretty good, but now my unwillingness to do my homework is coming back. Here’s some of the “reasons” I don’t do my homework. First of all, I usually go to my phone right away after school. I then go into a rabbit hole of watching YouTube videos or scrolling through Reddit. Another thing I do is once my parents come home I immediately want to go do things with them. Lastly, even when I do my homework, I have zero self control and just do something else. Plus the homework isn’t even that difficult for me. I just need to put in the effort to do it. It doesn’t help that my grades are good, mostly low As and high Bs. 

Tl;dr I overly procrastinate on my homework and don’t know how to stop it.",1

11,Should I threaten to move states to get my older sister to treat me and my wife with basic human respect?,"  The threat isn't an idle one, my wife and I plan to move to a little mountain town a state away, the threat is really ""instead of moving few years from now, we'll be  moving in a year in a half.""
  Okay, so, backstory time, about 4 years ago exactly, my now wife and I started dating in highschool and my mother and sister started being verbally and socially abusive to me and her for about a year and a half following the start of our relationship. With several instances of my mother disregarding every interest or hobby of mine as being caused by my Asbergers syndrome. After a discussion with her asking her not to connect everything I love and everything that I felt made me me, continued to bring it up but by beginning the statement as' ""oh, it probably because of your,"" then she would look me in the eye, smile, and say in this infuriating tone, ""I'm sorry""
  Both she and my sister would both claim that my girlfriend and my entire diet consisted of pizza, with many references to it a week. At times I felt like it was the only attribute they assigned to me in their eyes, just some sort of humorless caricature. My sister told my family about this and claimed it was a funny inside joke, causing us to never be able to escape this whole pizza situation. This came to a head when I got one if the highest ACT scores at my school, like the top five. My science teacher told me to use it as leverage to get something I wanted at home. I asked my mom if she would reward this accomplishment with refraining to refer to me or my girlfriend's diet, pizza or otherwise. This was met with ridicule from my mom, but after talking to my sister, she was finally on my side for once... for less than a day because I wasn't talking to my mom because I was understandably still upset. After hearing about it, my sister hopped right back over to my mom's side.
  Other things occurred during that time, like my mom poor-shaming my girlfriend and both of our best friends, her editing my resume when I was looking for a job to read that I'm a bad person and worker with no work ethic nor drive. This is all coming up now because we've since grownup (or so I thought) and have, in a way, compiled a semblance of an mutual, healthy familial relationship, infact, my now wife viewed my sister as a true friend, that is until last night where my sister said that it's all a show and that she still hates my wife for some unknown sin she committed in the eyes of my sister. And she apparently wants to talk about it and I plan to leverage the one thing I have over her, myself. Apparently she still loves me, her little brother, and feels that my wife took me away from her, while it was infact her leaving me with nobody to listen to me beside my then girlfriend.

715,Salvageable?,"Buckle up reddit you are in for a long story. Now, where to begin... alright sophomore year of high school. You are no longer a freshman but you aren't really upper class. I had just turned 15 and was about to begin school. I play  a lot of video games, overwatch being the one I played most at the time. It was around midnight when my online friend invited someone he sometimes played with. This is where it all began the night I met her. Now to fully understand the story I had to start this far back. Every detail  is important and I want to make sure I convey that. We began talking on her birthday I had finally mustered up the courage to message her to ask if she wanted to play some overwatch. She said Yes and we hit it off. We began playing together every chance that we got, talking about our lives and how we didn't really enjoy school or other people but somehow we enjoyed each other. She was just starting her junior year and she had just turned 16. I had found someone who I had cherished. We eventually shared where one another lived and we were states apart, but I often took trips to her state as some family lived there. Before I get to going to her state let me tell you of a trip before. I went to visit someone the opposite direction of her state and we texted the entire time, we stopped talking about video games and focused more on each others tastes. After a day of being gone she told me she missed me. This blew me away, so I told her I missed her too. More weeks pass with more talking and finally I start my trip to her state. This trip is when I told her I loved after a month and a half. When she didn't reciprocate it made me realize we needed more time so we stopped talking for a couple days but withing a few days she  texted me and we quickly began talking again. More time passes and we are coming towards the end of the first semester of Sophomore year. Thanksgiving. With only one minor hiccup prior to this we had been talking fairly consistently. For thanksgiving I went across the united states from the east coast to the west. Of course we talked during this trip but at the end of it something happened. I was asked her if I could once I got back home I could fly to visit her. She dodged the question and we talked about thanksgiving. A day before I fly back home I ask if she wants to play Xbox when I get back, but there was no answer. I assumed she was busy and after a day, an overnight flight and tons of update texts from me still nothing. For a month nothing, for two months nothing. I realized I had been coming on too strong and scared her off, she removed me on xbox, and messaging. Its been over a year since I met her and nearly a year since we last spoke. Its been two months of junior year and I'm still heartbroken but thinking of it today there is still one more way to contact her. Do I bother? Should I give it one last hurrah and if nothing still, then give up? To be honest I don't want to forget her, I don't want to stop loving her but is it about time i give up?

Seriously. I knew from pretty much the second we started talking. He compliments me constantly, to the point where I don't really know what to say anymore. I once messaged him ""who am I"" as a joke, and he responded with a massive paragraph full of flowery metaphors, telling me I was the most interesting and unique person he'd ever met.

It never devolved into creepy territory though (at least from what I could tell), despite how that may sound. He never pressures me into doing anything or acts entitled or whatever. Honestly, he never really asks me for anything in general. Mostly he'll just ask me questions about myself. ""Hey, how are you,"" stuff like that. He also sends me songs all the time, a lot of which are love songs, but that could just be coincidence. There have been other things that clued me in that he had a crush on me, but the compliments are probably the most important. 

Now for the context of my question. Since I had known him for a while and could see that he was a good person, and since it was very clear he had an awkward crush on me, I decided to ask him about it upfront because I knew he wouldn't ever say anything. The conversation went something like this (this was through text, I would've done it in person but I never get the chance to see him or any of my friends outside of school):

Me: Hey, do you have a crush on me? Yes or no?
Him: Or
Me: That's not yes/no
Him: /
Me: I would think that if you didn't, you'd just say no instead of dodging the question
(a bunch of similar caliber vague responses from him later)
Me: Look, it's okay if you like me that way. I think you're cool too, and I'm willing to try dating if you want

And then he responded with a huge paragraph saying that he doesn't know if he *should* date me, because he doesn't know if he's in love or if it's just his hormones (his words not mine). So basically, congratulations dude, you played yourself.

I was completely bewildered and didn't really know what to say, so I just respected his decision and left it at that. But now he acts as though that conversation never happened. He still compliments me constantly, still looks at me from across the classroom, still does everything he used to do. I haven't really talked to him in a while, not out of ill will or anything, but just because I'm so baffled by his behavior that I don't know what to do anymore.

I do really like him as a person. He's been nothing but pleasant up until this point, and he's still being pleasant, just confusing. I want to confront him about it, but I don't want to seem like I'm ""desperate to date him"" or whatever, because I'm kinda paranoid that that's what he wants to get out of me. Then again, I'm just a really paranoid person in general.

So what do you think I should do? I'm pretty sure I still like him somewhat. Should I really ask him again, or should I just give up? I would definitely like to remain his friend if nothing else, because he seems like a genuinely good person. I can give more info if it's necessary.

Also, please tell me if I'm being a jerk here or something. I don't have much experience with relationships, but I'm pretty sure this isn't something that normally happens.

TLDR: My guy friend, who seems like a genuinely good person so far, has a very obvious crush on me. But he told me no when I asked him if he wanted to try dating, and then pretended that conversation never happened.",1
222,Ideas for remote team-building activities,"Hi Redditors!

Sorry if this is too work related or if this isn’t the right forum for this, if so please point me in the right direction!

I’ve been tasked with coming up with some ideas for a team-building/fun activity that we can do with a number of different teams who work for the same function but in different geographies. Basically we want them to feel more connected and collaborative but unfortunately we are limited by the fact that they are not all coming together at the same time, instead there is going to be a series of workshops, one for each region, happening over the course of a couple of weeks. 

We want to try and do some interesting activity that connects them all, something along the lines of a chain-reaction/relay race type exercise where the first team completes part of a task then passes it onto the next team and so on.  The difficulty is that we want each workshop to be fun in and of itself, so something where it only all comes together in the end is great but we want each step to feel engaging, not just the final step.

I’ve had some ideas already but wanted to reach out to the creative minds of reddit to see if anyone else could provide some inspiration or had any good ideas. 

Thank you!!",1

The problem is, I can't. I don't have the time. I am studying at a military academy in Romania, I'm going to be a pilot. Anyways, the problem is that I can't go out when I want, and I don't have the time necessary for it. I could sneek out during the nights but even so in the best case I have 6 hours free and it is pretty risky. Uber is not an option, my dad's car is too old and it is my dad's he is gonna need it.

729,i’m worried about an upcoming vacation with my boyfriend,"So I’ve recently set up a vacation with my boyfriend to go visit my mother in Florida. my mother has agreed to pay for my visit, considering i’m her daughter, and my boyfriend has to pay for himself (the ticket is somewhere around 300 dollars, but the price goes up the longer you take to buy the ticket)

I’d like to state that he knew about this as soon as i knew. 

The issue here is that my boyfriend is 18 with no job. he’s been talking about getting one for months but he’s yet to do so. he put in ONE application for McDonald’s, and i told him that he can’t rely on JUST one application, and that he needs to put in more than that. the vacation is set for this march, so in about 5 months or so.

the thing about me is that every time i have traveled alone, ive hated it and the entire vacation because i get TERRIBLY homesick. i love my mother but i don’t think i can stand an entire week with her, seeing as she’s ALWAYS got something planned and i’d rather just relax, it’s a VACATION. we’re always running around and driving and doing everything, which is nice, but i absolutely hate vacationing with my mother for that reason. the idea of being left alone on this vacation tears me apart and gives me anxiety.

my boyfriend also knows this, because last time i went to vacation with my mother it was awful, i called him every night crying because i wanted to come home. when i set up these vacation plans with my mother, of course i had the idea in mind that my boyfriend would be with me, and it wouldn’t be as bad.

so now he’s complaining about “why do you get payed for and i don’t?” and i very quickly explained that it’s because i’m literally her daughter and he’s not. my mom already does so much for me, and paying just for one flight ticket and planning out this whole vacation, so i never expected her to pay for him in the first place. i think it’s disrespectful that he even asked in the first place.

anyway, my boyfriend and our best friend are planning a cruise together, which i didn’t mind at all considering it’d only be 3-4 days, and i didn’t think it’d get in the way of the vacation that we have planned. however, he’s complaining now about how he has to “pay for so much” (referring to both the cruise and our own vacation) of course this upset me because we had our vacation planned first, and i REALLY don’t want to be left alone on this, and i won’t be able to cancel because my ticket is already payed for. he’s acting like he’s not gonna pay for his ticket like he agreed to do two months ago, and i keep telling him that he NEEDS to get a job and start saving up as soon as he can so that he can save up and avoid the stress. well, i’ve had 0 luck finding him a job and he’s barely put in the effort to do so. and it’s really starting to irk me. he keeps saying he’s gonna get a job and put in more applications but i’ve heard it so many times that there’s no point in believing it anymore. starting to think it’s a lost cause and that i should cancel the trip altogether

i wasn’t really sure what to do about it so i came to reddit lol",1
411,Bf has controlling sis,"I'm 22F, he's 24M. His sis is 26F. He and I live 2hrs apart. We are close &amp; plan to get engaged/married in the near future &amp; it seems like the sis could sabotage the plans or try hard to do it. My bf babysits her 2 y/o son free so much per week b/c of her manipulation. She says things like ""I gave you a cute nephew, the best gift of all"" and says he's a ""bad uncle"" if he ever won't. He does not live w/ them or even that close to them and only makes $15/hr at his job. Her and her hubby make a lot of money - she's an RN and he is an area supervisor for a fast food chain &amp; owns 5 local said fast food restaurants so you better believe they could either pay him or get someone else, but they are cheap. She told him he could not move to be w/ me (b/c of the little kid apparently). Bf loves me but is tight with his sis. He even said he would ""probably"" choose me -_- Advice please. My bf kinda seems partially aware about this control but doesn't seem to get it completely and sadly enables it for the most part. He says that he would have to deal with ""snottyness"" from them (if he wanted to visit them) if he ""pissed them off"" so he seems afraid to do that.

244,my (white) gf uses the n-word,"me and this girl have been friends for over a year and we started hanging out with a lot of kids who are into drugs and gangs.. so they tend to use the n-word regularly. its very annoying and disgusting imo. 

but me and my other friend always call out our friend who uses the n-word  every time she says it. recently she has been saying it more and more and it’s just part of her vocab now. me and my friend kinda just gave up on telling her shit bc it’s just pointless. 

but it makes me feel sooo gross and uncomfortable and embarrassed when she says it bc she’s literally the whitest girl ever and i don’t want to see like a friend who just lets their friends say shit like that 

so any advice on how to get her to stop or is it just pointless to try at this point ?

267,"Being bullied at work for deciding it wasn't safe to go in to work, the manager's actions inspired the bullying.","So I had been rostered on for a graveyard shift at work, which meant finishing at 8am on what is usually considered my day off because it is when I go to a weekly LARP event in the evening. The roster was changed at during that day and I didn't notice until the next day at some point in the afternoon. A shift that I had to do started at five and I had no chance to adjust my sleep for the new shift because I had already slept in on the day I needed to start adjusting my sleep to be able to get up early enough. It was storming that day as well anyway and seeing as I only have a motorbike and an hour to get to work I obviously checked the weather forecast for the next day and seeing as it was stormy and 14C I had decided it was a bad idea to be riding in such weather given that last time I had to ride in a pownpour in the dark I had to sit at 60km/hr max to not lose traction or sight of the road far enough ahead to ride safely and all of my riding gear had been soaked through so thoroughly that it was still damp a week later. So because it was so late when I had a chance to respond to the change of roster I texted my boss saying that I thought it was a bad idea to go to work.

The next shift I had one of my colleagues (X) spent the last two hours of my shift berating me about how a little bit of rain isn't a valid excuse to not go to work. Saying that me not going to work in my situation was like the idea of her calling in sick because she's get a little damp running from her car to the front door.

I texted my boss saying basically, ""Hey, I've been told by X that there's a rumour going around that I didn't come to work because I am afraid of a little water, here's my reasoning why I feel totally justified in not going."" His response was that there is no rumour because it is the truth. What do I do? If I can't go to my manager about people bullying me then what do I do?

What do I do about finding a job where people won't treat me like shit so much of the time?",1

106,Parent to a girl that is now pregnant at 14 years old,"Hello, I am not the parent. I am posting on behalf of a close friend going through this situation. The parent is actually their grandmother who is their legal guardian.

 The grandmother took guardianship of the kids (The 14 year old girl and a 16 year old boy) after their mother, her daughter, died from Cancer shortly after they were born. 

The grandmother is a single woman that works 2 jobs to provide the best she can for these teenagers, but due to puberty they are going through phases. The teenage boy wants to be a rebel and is messing up in school getting bad grades hanging with gangsters while the 14 year old girl has been sneaking out of the house while the grandmother is at work to meet up with guys much older than her.

Not too long after her 14th birthday last month the family found out the girl is pregnant. She was somehow able to hide signs and her stomach for months. However her eating habits changed drastically and when the family joked and said she eats like a pregnant woman, she admitted that its because she was. The family was speechless and she told them that her friends mom had taken her to get pregnancy tests months back to confirm. They took her to the Doctor the following day and the doctor said she will be due in January! Meaning she was already past 6 months when they found out and pregnant at 13. 

The grandmother is not processing this at all. The family has tried to get the girl to give details about the man who impregnated her but she keeps giving lies about his age, his name and the rest of his identity. She said he is 16, but the family believes he could actually be an adult or twice her age. 

There is literally no one that can take care of the baby once its born. The grandmother works day in and out 2 jobs, she already cant afford anything besides food and bills. The kids are still children themselves and family lives in another state. The 14 year old is being a 14 year old saying she wants the baby, thinks its ""cute"" and doesn't think this will change anything. The grandmother is basically so stressed out or in shock that she is acting like nothing happened at all. 

Is there any advice that can be given in this situation? Can anyone give information on how adoption works? -- Since she is a child does her permission need to be given in order for the baby to be given for adoption?",1
445,is it my fault? can I still fix things? or does he just want to keep things casual? or.. what?,"I've (22f) been seeing this guy for quite some time. but I'm not sure how he feels? we've only been on 2 dates. he introduced me to some of his friends straight away from the first date, I met more of his friends on the second. also we had sex since the first date as well.

**here's the thing I regret the most:** I told him that ""I don't want to feel things"" during pillow talk (before the sex) because I was really scared of getting attached. and I thought it was an ethical thing to do to let him know before we did anything. and he tried to relate to my situation anyway.

the sex was great, he was really appreciative and really sweet, he got out of the room and brought me a glass of water right after. he kissed my forehead a lot while we were sleeping. the next morning he said that I was really cute and everything, we watched Netflix.. and he asked me if I wanted to go to a family event with him later that day. and I said no because I thought that was a bit too soon. wasn't it? anyway, I eventually told him I had to go home and he ordered me an uber even though I said I could just catch the bus.

I texted him saying that I had a great time and he replied saying that he did too and that ""you can hmu anytime :)"" the convo ended up with me sending a funny vid, he said he loved it, I said ""glad you loved it"", and he didn't reply ?

so I texted him the next day asking him about the family event, etc.. I don't know, I kinda felt like I made a little more effort into the texting but he might just be bad at texting and busy with work. so I stopped replying when he replied with a short one (which only happened once)

we eventually went on a second date, ended up meeting more of his friends. he told me that he's happy that he got to see me. his friend told me that he was really hyping me up, saying that I'm so hot, etc.

**I did something I regret again:** I told him that ""I just wanna be emotionally detached"" when he said that life is about trying again after we fail or get hurt. why the fuck did I say that??? idiot!!

anyway, he was still very affectionate with me the whole time, made sure I'd been having a good time, very appreciative and sweet. I realised that he actually been paying attention to me and things I like, etc. we ended up having fantastic sex. he woke up late for work the next morning because we went to bed at like 5. so we didn't have much time to talk. he ordered me an uber again which I think is really sweet, he didn't have to do that.

texted him again thanking him for last night and he said thanks for coming, etc etc.. again, he didn't seem to make much effort into texting. but he does work in a fast phased kitchen (13-14hrs shifts) so that could be a factor.

a couple of days later, **he went MIA from texting and from work.** I found out a few days later that his good friend had passed away. so I texted him saying that I was really sorry for his loss, and stuff. he said ""thanks so much x"" I didn't respond after that because I wanted to give him space. a few days later I texted him asking him how he's feeling. he replied 2 days later saying that he'd been super busy with work and a bit stressed out and that he hoped I had been doing well. so I told him that he can talk to me if he needed to talk. he replied 2 days later thanking me and telling me that he'd been getting so many messages sending him love and he's so grateful.

so that's sort of the pattern this past week. he'd been taking a lot of time to respond. it could be because he's been having a rough time. I really wish he'd talk to me about it. I found out that he went out with his mates the other night though? maybe that's what he needs right now.. anyway, I asked him out yesterday to see a movie later this week and he hasn't responded.

am I reading too much into this?? see this is why I'm scared to get attached. I overthink things when I care. I realised that I actually really like this guy from the second date. and I deeply regret saying that I wanna keep being emotionally detached. if you think this might've made him take a step back, do you think I can fix it? or do you think he just wanted to keep it casual from the start? or am I just an insensitive little bitch not understanding that he's going through a tough time?",1

I've noticed that she is shy, since the class we are in involves the class to talk and present assignments and projects, and she doesn't like to present, but she always does the assignments. She's nice and attractive, I worked with her in a partnered assignment a few weeks ago, and she didn't seem to be that shy talking to me. She also seems slightly lonely since she never seems to talk to many people, she sits alone during lunch, except for one day during the second or third week of school,  after school I saw her walking to the town square by our school which has restaurants, gyms, library, etc. which I was heading to the library and saw her with a guy, who I though was a girl(since he was skinny and had long braids or dreadlocks).

I also constantly imagine that someone is in front of my bedroom door as well. 
I have had these fears since I was about sixteen but lately they’ve gotten worse. And I’m not sure if it’s because I have Seasonal depression and it’s around that time where I get depressed and anxious. 

I know these are so incredibly irrational but I get so anxious and scared that I will be up until 7 where my family is up or when my boyfriend gets home (he works the graveyard shift) and only then do I feel a bit more comfortable resting. 

I would also like to say that my boyfriend lives with his brother and he sleeps in the basement and they also have a lot of security and locks so I know no one can get in and I know if someone did break in they would probably be caught before they even made it to the basement. (His brother lives upstairs with two dogs)

I used to go to therapy but had to stop because my insurance just like refused to pay or something and my mom and I would have to pay out of pocket and we can’t afford that. So therapy or anything is really out of the option. 

Light also doesn’t make me feel very safe either. My boyfriend has bought me a few night lights and they can sometimes worsen because I think I see a figure of someone. 

I really just want to know what I can do to make me feel safer or comfortable in both places I sleep. Like, I don’t want to be dreading sleep. 

Tl;dr: I have an overreactive imagination which causes me think bad things will happen to me and it haunts me until I see sunlight and I know people are awake.",1
705,Scared my friends are moving on,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but,

I (F15) recently just joined a new school, along with some other friends. All my other friends are making new friends, and branching out. I'm happy for them, but I can't help but feel a little left behind. I'm really scared we're gonna end up drifting.

I have my best friend in like 90% of all my classes, and I can't help but wonder if they're the reason why I haven't really been able to meet other people - seeing as they're always clinging to my side.

I don't know what to do, and I'm scared of being left in the dust.",1
189,Should I lie against my own conscience or not?,"So, first of i dont care if you'll call me a scumbag after this, it also won't solve my problem.

But anyways, here is my problem:

So i was at a friends sleepover the other day and there is this one girl who i have a crash on since literally ever. The thing is, i already confessed to her and she said, she wasnt really into me \[ :( \].But i still love her, and everytime i see her, I feel happy and like life isnt meaningless anymore.  But how it is with sleepovers and partys, we drank some alcohol and she got reasonably drunk. Now, my dumbass brain thought: ""Hey, why not cuddle with her cause she wont say no the way she is rn."" Well, so we did.

And I can say, ive probably never felt more content in my life. I cant really describe this feeling with words, but I hope you get what i mean.If i could bring back this moment, i would anytime..

Ok, fast forward a few hours, we (she, me and my friends who were also there) decided to go to sleep, and she sleeps on the mattress right in front of me. Since i was still a bit drunk, and somewhat turned on (thats the part, where i wish i had an undo button for real life actions) my dumbass thinks: ""Man, thats the prettiest girl you've ever seen and so must feel her ass. Well, my heart poundin like a jackhammer, i reach out and try to touch her ass. As soon as i touch it (not with like one finger but my whole hand), she moves a  few centimeters away from me and i take my hand back as fast as possible.

The morning we woke up, we all get rid of the rubbish we left and i find myself to be alone with her. Now she goes: ""Have you been touching my ass last night?"" I literally die inside and instinctively say: ""no."", but she didnt really seem satisfied with that answer. Well now ive texted her and asked, if she expected a different answer. She didnt exactly say yes, but she told me, she was pretty certain, that she didnt imagine it.

Then I asked her, what she expected and she answered, that it was up to her to decide, whether she trusts me or not.

And sadly she does. I've asked her, what she would think if i did do it, and what if not. She answered, that she would find that reeeeaaallly shitty on my part.

So now i basically have to decide, whether i confess to her and tell her, that i did do it, and i have to live with the consequences (which is really shitty for me, because i goddamn love her), or i have to lie to both her and myself and say, that i indeed didnt do it, which itself is also pretty scetchy since she already said, that she doesnt believe she imagined all this.

I can lie to almost any person, but with her its something different. It feels wrong when i do it to her.....Like really wrong. Its like i hurt myself with it.

What am i supposed to do now? Tell the truth and hope she forgives me and moves on, or lie and pretend like it didnt happen?

I know, that the event itself might not be the biggest problem, but she trusts me, and i dont want to lose this. So basically it has turned into a dilemma, where I could either lose her faith, or lie to her and feel really shitty and then she will probably think different of me....

I hope you understand my problem...

67,"(M20) Seriously need advice, feel like total failure","I am 20 yo male. Finished Electrotehnician trade school. Last year i enrolled into university on Logistics (3 year). The thing is i live in extremely corrupt third world country (Croatia) and this university was created just in order for people to get employed and to pull money. Some of the professors are actual convicted criminals (financial maleversations and similar). The exams where so EASY...like basic physcis from elementary school. Only math was done as it should be.  While i was there for a year I almost didnt learn anything new. Everything was so easy and i was just extremely bored. I started doing student jobs just because i felt like i was absolutely wasting my time. It was extremely hard for me to even get up and go to classes (we had to go certain number of hours else you fail a year).    


At one point professor started requiring us to bring notebooks and our own material to the class that is aboslutely shit, like it was elementary school. Those who didnt bring their material where sent away and didnt counted as they came to the class . That was what made it tip over for me. I didnt go to the university to listen to elementary school level classes and professors that were there just to be emplyoed. I went to the university to learn about Logistics and its implementation in the real world and how its all done in practice. People from higher years where telling us that it will be easier later, since for some reason people in my class strugeled with subject like basic physics. I could have easily continued and got my degree (its all free in croatia if you are student for first time). But I just cant bring myself waste my life away like that.   


So i quit going to collage in May this year. I continued working student jobs because I do not want to be death weight to my parents. Student jobs where mostly manual labor, like spilling old beer, making boxes in factory and similar no brain stuff, that i found extremely boring but at least other students company was alright and pay was decent. Also with that spare brain power I just downloaded alot of books and listened to them while working. Rich dad poor dad (i know not the best book but it is good for motvation) and things like Richest man in babylon.  Working on that jobs gave me alot of time to think about what i want to do:  


One of my biggest life problems is that I get excited about something.I learn alot about it and then I get extremely bored and can no longer do it.  What i know all my life is that i always loved science. I always switched from different subjects of science but it always interested me. Again my problem with this is that I absolutely hate school education. Teachers in electrotehnician school killed my interest in electronics for 2 years. Before it i was always tinkering with stuff. Only while a year since trade school has passed and through alot of thinking on the student job i started going back to electronics.  I realized that i actually now have knowledge and ability to make things I always dreamed of as a child, such as functional electronic prosthesis, various gadgets and similar. That field is limitless and i think I wont get bored easily with it. I decided i will go to one of two Mechatronics Universities in cities close to mine. Ofcourse i will pay everything out of my own pocket as i made enough on student jobs.   


My plan i decided then was this:  


1. When my student right expire get a real job
2. Start learning programming and tinkering with arduinos, 3d printing and stuff. My first big goal is to create underwater drone protoype  for underwater search and rescue operations. Also one is to create functional muscle electric impulse arduino controlled prosthesis and give them for free to people that lack hands. I will see where that will lead me if i manage to do such things.
3. Finish higher level of state exams so I have higher chances of entering as a regular student so I wont have to pay as much, even though I have decent chance of attending such unversity even with state exams i finished before.
4. Enroll on Mechantronics University  


I am now at STEP 1 AND 2., step 2 is awesome and I am slowly but surely making progresses and learning with spare time I have. My main problem right now is STEP 1. I got a ""real"" job but it is a hell for me. Let me explain. Month and a half ago my father started pressuring me to find a job as fast as possible, as time went i was looking for suitable job that i would fit in, he started pressuring me more and even threatening to throw me out if i dont find a job before end of the month.  Because of that i felt like absolute failure who cant achieve anything in his life, as i quit even a fucking elementary school level easy university. Because of his pressuring I just took first job i could....and now its absolute torture for me.  Im now working as ""electrician"" construction worker, I know alot of theory and understand what is what and what are we doing, but i dont have any practical expericence in such a job as all we did in trade school was electronics and not manually setting the wires in the house. 80% of work on the job is mixing gyps and prepearing the walls for outlets and wires. I do not like that kind of work but I look at it from perspective that I will learn how to do a trade, and if i know how to do that I could always in future find such a job. But the huge problem for me is that our supervisor is egotriping rednieck who is just  constantly flexing on us and is quite rude, he  told me  that he is not a professor and that he is not gonna teach me anything.  He is afraid  that some of us younger guys will replace him. The other guys on the work are not much better, there is one guy who is okay but the rest of them are too just rednecks with who me as a nerdy guy just cant fit in. I tried to be friendly, i tried to show the respect and that i am willing to listen and learn from the supervisor guy, but all i got in return was mockery, rudness and dissrespect.  The work is extremely boring to me and i just cant stand it, I feel like i am in my worst moments of highschool again where i was too surrounded by rednecks and ego tripping educators. On one of my pervious jobs as student, that was similar to this one where i was installing security cameras and stuff...i was fitting with workers there great and it was awsome, i was able to have intelectual conversations with guy who was supervisor and it was fun, nice and i learned alot. I contacted owner of that company for job but he does not need any workers right now. 

I was a retard to allow my father pressuring and got myself into the job i hate with people i cant make any connection with (its teamwork job at that..). I feel like my self confidence is dropping slowly as in my worst moments of highschool where i almost failed a year. Today at 10th day of the job while operating a heavy drill machine I made mistake and almost broke my hand with it......and first thing i thought was how good it would be since i would have a reason to not work on this job.  I dont think that is exactly healthy so thats why i decided to write my thoughts on this sub.  


So i am failing already at step one. My plan is to keep applying to better jobs in the area and switch jobs. Sadly there is almost no companies that do things with electronics in my area, those that do require university degrees.  


I feel like i am just a failure,  good for nothing manchild who cant do anything properly. Not even finish a univeristy degree that is actually EASY piece of cake to him...one of my big problems is that always it is extremely hard for me to find motivation.  Like when i almost failed a year, i had a last chance to pass one of the classes so i can go to the Highschool senior year, it took me till 2 hours before the test started to actually start learning. I had everything prepeared and was ready at 5PM to start learning. I was there in my room forcing myself to start learning but failed, then i went to sleep ant woke up at 3 AM to start learning. I was unable too...i dont fucking know why. Only at 5 AM did i manage to force myself to start learning and learned whole year in 2 hours. It was on of the hardest classes we had. Why the fuck do i have to be so dumb idiot to make myself like that?  


As a child in school i was sent to many psychiatrists because I absolutely refused to write my homeworks and write in class. Because of the same feeling i have had as in that moments when i need to make myself study.  As 18 yo i found results from that meetigs and I only diagnosis was Suspicion of ADHD but i was not diagnosed with anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

While training Jiu JItsu i had strict discipline and didnt miss any training for 2 years. Even when i was sick or annoyed by training collages, or bored. Reaosn i paused it is that when i finished highschool and enrolled in university + car school+ serious girlfriend relationship + student jobs, i didnt had much time left to spare. So i dont think discipline is the problem. Or is it?  


I can stay concentrated  on things for hours easily, for days if subjecti s really interesting to me. When i was in interesting classes or when i now go to language school to learn German that i pay for. I can with no problem listen to something for 3 hours and keep cocentration. I even meditate mindfulness so it may be even better than average. So i dont think concentration is the problem?  


Am i lazy? Do i have some mental condition like ADHD since i absolutely loose motivation for some things extremely quickly? My self esteem has really fallen lately so i question is my image of myself absolutely wrong. I am just stupid idiot adolescent who is lazy and just looks for excuses for his failings?  Am i just typical millenial who has it too good? Please judge me and give me your opinions.

145,Some academic/legal perspective appreciated,"Hey so I'm here for some big time advice and speaking about time I'm running out. I'm in my room right now but this morning I had a high division engineering class in Factory Simulation II and I wunt going to do fine. As a matter of fact I went to sleep last night feeling like I was doing fine on the practice questions and the practices exam on the other tab so soon I felt sleepy and gone to sleep. So this morning rolls around and I realize I'm missing half what I know and the more I reviewed the less I was feeling confident. I go in and sit by my friend who is basically aimbot godmoding each quiz we took so far. I ended up word-for-word copying the entire exam page1-5, except here's the drift: I made intentional mistakes to mask my word-for-word tactic. Ok. I'm ready hand in my paper as there is only 2 more minutes left. So I get up hand the paper and proceed to meet with some acquaintances out by the hall. This where shit turns green. I find out not only that there are A/B forms but there is A-D forms and that's when my ears started heating up and ringing. I'm not going to reveal which school I go to but academic integrity is something they take real serous around here where I will be guaranteed an F in all my classes for the semester which is not really smart to settle for, plus if it gets to my parents then I am for sure done for in many ways like yooo. So I walk back into the room to my professor and ask him if I can just glance on my answer for the long answers: question 2. He agreed and I was looking at my form letter as I found out that the guy I picked up EVERYTHING from has form B, mine was D. Long story short I ended up running away with my test and he chased me down the hall and yelled for other students to get me but there wasn't anyone but a janitor lady. Soooo there isn't many cameras around on campus and the ones they installed are one everyone knows about. I successfully managed to evade the entire campus for the day and haven't opened my email yet.  This professor happens to be my academic advisor simultaneously so I'm almost certain I've got at least an e-mail from him by now. From what I know he has no solid evidence against my violation of the academic integrity what so ever and I've got the upper hand against him if I play it like nothing happened. As a matter of fact I'm already starting to forget parts of what happened I don't know if that's some psychological bs or what. What can I do to improve my position??? And have I miss calculated the entire thing? If so give me detailed explanation to why I should've considered the conventional alternative? I'm really looking for voice, word, or encouragement someone tell me what I should do next!!!!!!!",1

First of all i would like you all to know that where i live people are ultra conservative, so sorry in advance for any misgendering and all, kinda not used to it but i am still learning. I used to be a very popular guy in my high school, so when i got invited to a graduation July of this year (i was a junior) i went and beside me was what i now know is the person i love, i saw clearly a female face in a mans suit so i was intrigued, we talked and eventually we started going out on what i thought where dates (she didn't see them that way) and we seem to hit it off for a future relationship, shortly after, friend groups notice i was going out with this person and stopped hanging out with me(knew that would happen) because you know ""super conservative"", i stopped being popular at school and now shits going down. As i get to know this person i start to uncover a lot of issues this person has, both psychological and physical that would make any man run away in an instant, but i stayed, convinced that maybe one day i could be with the person i love and perhaps help her in her quest for stability. So after all that i tell her how i feel after 2 months of ""dating"", and was rejected, honestly i expected it, but indeed i kept myself in there hoping one day she will feel the same way about me. 3 months later and now i am getting tired, i had never been rejected before in my life , i was always hit on by girls and so on so i never got to experience that, and its strange being rejected by the only person i have truly loved, and being that she is a female to male trans person makes it all the more strange for me.Now i am here wondering what should i do. 

Should i let go? Was all this for nothing?Should i wait and throw one last hail marry to see if maybe one day she feels the same? Should i tell her i do not want to be friends and that i seek something else?

Maybe i just needed to tell someone this, if you read this thank you and sorry if you did not understand my bad writing",1

It’s been a lot for him, but financially we’ve been okay and I’ve tried to work as much as I can. I’m finally in a better work environment and now that things have been stable, he’s lost all interest, or maybe I’m just realizing this. He plays video games all week and all weekend and goes out during the week so I barely seen him then. I guess I need more.

I don’t really like to play video games anymore so I don’t sit out in the living room with him just to watch him play. When I ask if he wants to cuddle and watch a movie he complains and honestly, it’s hard to sit and watch him play games for hours because they make him angry. 

Every time I mention him doing something with me, he gets sarcastic with me, and it hurts my feelings. I don’t know if he resents me? Or just doesn’t love me?

The help isnt for my sake, but my girlfriends. My girlfriend is severely depressed and I do my best to keep her happy, make her smile and stop her from self harm, I try and do all I can for her but this call for help isnt based around me helping her; thats the things i'm okay with. The issue is every now and again when she's having her breakdowns she'll post dark and/or depressing lyrics on her story- which obviously we can all comprehend, but sometimes she'll post encrypted messages - which I do not understand. I've looked into the type of encryption and so far all i've found is frequency and adudio encrytion, the only problem is the page I found this on had pre made copypasta ones with no translations, I tried google translate to see if it was a foreign language and I tried so many other decryption methods so I need you, the people of reddit to help me; from the everyday people of reddit to the highly skilled audio technicians and computer genuises, I plead for your help. The last one she posted on her story said ""J epo'u fwfo gffm bmjwf boznpsf nz cpez boe njoe bsf efbe boe j'n tp fyibvtufe pg gffmjoh uijt"" see what I mean by its hard to translate? (Also I know it going to be dark and sad because she usually includes a backround photo) if she's posts anymore of these i'll edit this post and use them as examples
Thank you all for your to those who attempt to translate it and all those who get back to me &lt;3",1
245,Past best friend accused of rape,"This will be long ... But I'd like an advice.
I knew this guy for 8 or so months, and he quickly became one of my closest friends. We'd spend so much time together. I'm a 22 y/o female and he is a 22 y/o male, we met in our uni.
He is extremely intelligent, a nice person, and would do so much for me (he set me up with 2 people I dated, helped me with exams even though he didn't even take my courses, etc.) He is also a past orthodox Jew, still in touch with his family but is not supported by them financially and no longer believes in God. I don't know if it matters, but he is also very very, ""objectively"" not attractive. He's pretty secretive about his past, and has told me that he has a tendency to lie, but I'm one of the only people he's trying not to lie to. 

About 2 months before the instance, we had a big fight and stopped talking. I wrote him a really long text, and he ignored it for weeks until finally I asked for a reply and he, in short, told me he's not interested in our relationship anymore, he questioned my love for him but asked me for 'evidance', said that I'm immature, and that we'd get back in touch when I grow up. I was angry, but tried moving past it.
Long story relatively short, during the summer vacation he was charged with the violent rape of a 14 y/o mentally ill girl.
He called me from the detention center and acted like nothing happened, said he missed me and it's a shame we stopped our friendship over a silly argument.
I was pretty distraught throughout the conversation and had actively suspected him to be guilty. He said  ""You don't even know the true story. Well I guess if you think I could do something like that then we really shouldn't be friends...."" and I later found out from a friend that our conversation ""bummed him out"".

Recently I heard his side of the story from a mutual friend, basically he was drunk and high and saw this girl at a playground. They started talking and she said she broke up with her boyfriend and wanted to have sex with someone, right now. He asked her for her age, and she said 14, then he said he's leaving, and she changed her reply to 18, saying she was just kidding beforehand. 
During their conversation he notices that she's a little ""crazy"". Later on, they go to an abandoned school, kiss, he removes her top and she asks him to stop, he then asks her ""do you even know what having sex means? Do you know what is sex?"", They stop and he returns home. Later he finds out that there are cops looking for this girl, who ran away from a mental asylum, and confessed to everything that happened that night. Sounds crazy, I know.

According to him the girl dropped the accusations but he's still being prosecuted, things went wrong during investigations, they wrongly accuse him and the only evidence is his confession, and he's planning to sue them when it's over. Now he's out for home detention, I texted him to call me and have a closure and he is ignoring my text.

I think even if his story is true, it portrays him in a negative way, and I think he knew that this girl is underage but still proceeded with his actions nonetheless.
I decided that I don't want anything to do with him anymore. He hurt me quite a bit even though he was also incredible to me. But I can't get him off my head. I can't stop being angry at the fact that he's the one not responding to my texts. I get that he's hurt that I didn't believe him, but after everything that happened it's hard for me to blindly support him or even give him the benefit of the doubt. I want to move on from this, focus on my own life but I keep obsessing over it. I'm so scared seeing him in uni once this is over (seems like he's about to get out). It's like a dark cloud hovering above me. Any advice?

667,"Brother[14] stole $400 to buy gaming stuff, says he's okay with being kicked out of the house","(This is my second post ever so bear with me)

My parents dropped me off at campus this afternoon, and they as a couple often go out sunday afternoons, leaving my 14 y/o brother alone at the house.

It's never been a problem, since he just stays home and plays on his xbox. Until today, when we receive an email (I access my parents email frequently) which is a Best Buy reciept of $400, where he bought airpods, NBA2k20, a headset, and an uber gift card. It was cash. 

How do we know it was him? Ever since he found out that I got a good portion of my tuition refunded, hes been bugging me nonstop to buy him airpods. He's had other issues, including lying about where he was, using my credit card, stealing money from my stash, etc, so I havent felt like rewarding with anything, much less expensive airpods.  Today as they dropped me off at my dorm, he asked again, and I simply ignored him.

My mom called to ask him about a different email around this time and in that conversation, he said something about ""someone robbed us, used your credit card, etc"" and said there was an email with that information.  His lies started failing when we asked him to send us a screenshot of that email, since we all have access to it and couldn't find the one he said was there. 

While my parents are talking to them, I'm talking to best buy to see if they didnt find it at all suspicious that a 14 year old kid walked in and bought $400 worth of stuff. 

My parents call me back, saying he owned up to taking the money. He is ""okay if [my parents] kick him out of the house."" This part comes from my mom saying throughout our childhood that we could do anything we want, but not under her roof (ex: I can smoke all the weed I want, but I'm moving out of the house). No nonsense type.

I know this is more of a parent discipline issue, but I love my brother, and I just want to see if anyone has any advice on how a sibling should handle this? I am his older sister, and we do believe some of these behaviors stem from my life. 

What do I mean by that? I'm a goody two shoes essentially. I graduated top 10, got almost a full ride to college, never smoked/drank/taken drugs, never snucked out, etc. To some, I'm the ""perfect"" sibling no one wants to have. I've never compared our grades or anything like that, and I think our parents do a good job at not comparing us at all. 

Right now, my parents our on their way back home, and I dont know how they'll handle it there. 

But, as his sister, what can/should I do or not do with my little bro? I love my brother, so it hurts me to think he's doing these things at such a young age.",1
54,Should I confront her for being selective?,"Hi, so I'm a highschool student so I guess some of you may find this immature...

So in a lesson today, I made some very insensitive jokes with my friends. Then a girl that I used to be friends with (friendship ended badly) decides to call me out for being 'offensive' and 'immature'. Now what she said was 100% true, I am immature for an 18 year old and I don't mind saying sorry about my jokes. The only issue that I have with her confrontation is the fact that I don't often make offensive jokes but a specific group of guys in the class continuously make homophobic jokes (these guys are also actually homophobic for real) yet she does not call them out and its not like shes even friends with them. And to top that off, when her and I used to be close friends, we would both make extremely offensive jokes together and she was making the most jokes, so why are jokes all of a sudden offensive when she is not involved in making them? I know for a fact she is always more critical to females (even though she claims to be a 'radical feminist') but this has gone to far. Should I confront her about her 'queen bee syndrome' and the fact that she turns a blind eye when it comes to the guys but is quick to flame us girls?",1

152,How do you get over someone you dated when they were also your best friend?,"Reddit, I need your help!  

My daughter is a freshman in college, living in a dorm a couple hundred miles away.  Her high school boyfriend of two years joined the military after graduating and is now stationed out of state.  

They were very close right up until he left for boot camp and she left for college, but had previously discussed breaking up - amicably- after high school.  All their friends and family, myself included, supported this choice.   People do this all the time, right? A long distance relationship was not something they wanted to do.

So they parted ways, sad but both busy with a million new changes in their lives.  She dated a guy at school for a short time but broke it off quickly when she didn’t feel any sparks.  

Her high school boyfriend and she didn’t talk much while he was in boot camp- the rules restricted him to mailing letters.  Now that boot camp is over and he’s stationed elsewhere they resumed texting and Face-time.  

And this is why I’m writing:  During those two years of dating, they were also each other’s best friend.  She misses him and that aspect of their relationship- as well as the romantic aspects.  They wanted to be able to continue the friendly aspect- to talk and joke and be friends again- but old feelings are getting in the way.  He tells her he is ready to move on but then says he was hurt by her having already dated someone else for awhile.  He tells her about a cute girl he thinks he likes but then flirts with her.  My daughter’s heart is aching for what they had and she can’t get over him.  She feels like, since he was also her best friend, she doesn’t have anyone to talk to for help.  Her best girl friend from high school is sweet but hasn’t had a serious relationship before and has no advice.  

She asked me for advice:  I’ve tried reminding her of the million things about him that used to drive her crazy.  She thinks they don’t seem so bad anymore.  I’ve tried to compare him to a drug that is hurting her even though she craves it, and suggested she stop talking with him for a long period so she can recover and heal.  I’ve told her keeping him so close won’t give her (or him) room to heal.  She says she might cut back a little on the frequency of their talks, but I feel like that’s just pulling the bandaid off slowly instead of ripping it off, and sometimes when you pull it off slowly the edges might accidentally get pressed down again, making the agony last longer.

693,I M(27) asked my grandad M(65) to stop calling me tight and it all got a bit messy.,"To start things off, my grandad has always took the Micky out of people, mainly me. Sometimes it is a joke and other times he means it as an insult.  

The past 4 years my grandad has been making jokes at my expense by saying I'm tight. I dont mind a joke or banter and I'm not a snowflake but the problem is it's the same joke all the time and everytime we'll be at a family meal he will mention it and berate me for being ""tight"". He usually makes the tight comments when we are at an event or someones house, never when I'm visiting him. I've had a girlfriend for just over a year and on four occasions where we have all been at a family meal he has made the same tight comments and then asked my girlfriend If I ever pay for meals when we go out. I usually laugh it off because I cba to deal with him. 

After this meal I had had enough as it really got to me and I was fed up with him treating me like a piece of dirt. 

I waited a week or 2 and went round my grandad and grans F(62) house to speak to him about him constantly calling me tight. I was there for over 2 and half hours because I just didnt have the bottle to say anything and finally I did. I asked my Grandad nicely if he could stop calling me tight. He asked why and straight away said it was a joke. I stated I don't find it funny at all and I would appreciate it if he stopped calling me tight. My gran asked him to listen because I was being serious. 

My grandad then went on the offensive and started saying it's a joke and I cant hack it. I said, it isn't a joke as you believe it and you're meaning it as an insult. He then went on saying how I'm a bully and I am tight. I ask for an example of being tight and he could only think of one which was when we went out for a meal for my brothers passing out parade (my brother wasnt here for the meal). I couldn't remember this at all as this was 4 years ago but he said I had only paid for my meal and he called me greedy. I explained, why would I pay for everyones meals, you do a round of drinks not a round of food and If I had invited everyone out for the meal or the meal was for me then I would have offered. I also said I'm not rich, I cant afford to pay for everyone's meals and said hes greedy for wanting me to pay for his food. 

He then went on a tirade calling me shit at football. I stated, you're literally proving my point. You bully people and try to put them down. I said he does this to Uncle Ken M(40 - Son in Law to Grandad) and this is exactly the reason he never visits when his daughter comes up. Grandad then stands up and opens the door telling me to get the fuck out and I can fuck off. I stated I want to keep visiting, that's why I'm here and want to sort this out. He then sits back down again just calling me an argumentative brat, loads more swear words and trys to throw me out. I said fine and give my gran a kiss and say bye I wont be back. He said you better fucking not visit when I'm here. 

After this I was fuming and didnt know what to do. On one hand I'm proud of myself but on the other I didnt want this to go like that at all. 

It goes about two days and in this time I spoke to my gf (she didnt know I was going to do this) and she said shes proud of me and I've done the right thing. My dad M(44) is my grandads son just to clarify and my parents are divorced. I speak with my mum F(43) and she agrees I was right and my grandad acted rudely and shouldn't have spoken to me like that. My mum rang my gran as she was disgusted that my grandad spoke to me like that. I had asked her not to as I didnt want any more trouble but in her eyes she was just protecting her son. My gran said to her basically she agrees with me and that my grandad is wrong but he will never change his ways even though she wants him to. 

I had also messaged my dad in this time just to give him a heads up and he at the start tried to play it off as a massive joke. Like oh that's just grandad being grandad. I was pissed off and said something like it's not a joke dad, hes a bully and I ain't having it. 

My gran has messaged me in the mean time and stated she loves me and she is just piggy in the middle and we will have to sort it out between ourselves. 

Myself and the gf visited my Dad and Step-mum (F40). It was a good chat until I bought up the grandad situation. I was asking advice and i stated what was said exactly and how he was proper rude to me and why i wanted him to stop calling me tight and involving my gf. My step-mum then gets involved stating she doesnt think hes a bully but that be always makes jokes. I said yeah he makes jokes but he says the same one over and over to me and he doesnt even think it's a joke. He literally spoke to me like a piece of shit and kicked me out. Step-mum says it's because hes old and a different generation. I was like, that doesnt mean it's right and he can constantly insult me. I said if an old person is racist, it doesnt make them right, they need to move along with the times. Stepmum then says its because his son died (my uncle). This is over 21 years ago. She basically said he got aggressive because of this. 

She then said he is right and that I am tight. I was thinking that's proper rude to say. My dad hasn't said anything at this point. I said how am I tight and she goes on to say the most weirdest points ever. Apparently about 4 years ago when we went skiing, I didnt bring enough money from my bag to pay for skii hire so my dad spotted me some money and I never paid him back. I was gobsmacked and said I can't even remember that but that doesnt have anything to do with tightness. That's because I forgot to pay you back and just basically me being an idiot. (I genuinely cant even remember this happening but I said it's not even tightness that's me stealing, you should have said something and said I can pay it back now since you still think about it). 

She then moved on to say other times I've been tight at a pub with them. I said I've only stayed here twice. On one of those occasions me and my uncle Ken were doing rounds and the other I cant even remember but it would have been when everyone was there. If no one is doing rounds then why would I. She didnt have any answer and just mumbled and then said about me going round my Uncle Ken's and aunties and not buying them a gift when I stay around there.

Since I've been an adult, I have only stayed round my uncle Ken's and aunties 5 times. 3 of them times I had been living abroad and 2 of the 3 times I literally flew back just to see them for a week. Now here I even said to her, I didnt realise I was expected to get a gift for someone everytime I stay round someones house. I'm genuinely not made of money and that I've just never been told to buy people gifts for when i stay round there houses. I said it's just my bad etiquette. 

Step mum then didnt say any other examples and then went onto how I am argumentative which I agree and I'm opinionated but I said, how is that anything to do with grandad calling me tight and me asking him to stop. She then goes on to say that at one of the meals my dad paid for the drinks and I didnt even offer. Her son had offered to split the drinks bill with my dad but said not to as I wont offer. Again I was fuming but didnt rise and said for one i thought uncle Ken paid for all the meal including the drinks, hence why he walked in and everyone thanked him and everyone said he shouldn't have paid for it and I offered to pay half. I didnt know dad had paid for the drinks. 

I then just killed the conversation as I was raging inside. Me and the gf left and now I'm struggling to get to sleep as I honestly dont know what the fuck just went on then. My dad didnt really say a word (no backbone), I came for advice and then I got insulted for not paying something which was 4 years ago haha. 

I genuinely dont know what to do, its 2am and I'm contemplating never speaking to my dads side of the family again its angered me that much .",1
339,WhatsApp friend chats,"Heya

I love having friends to tall to, but dont think I have that at the moment...

I'm in a ""friendship circle"" and in 2 whatsapp groups. 1 for all 11 of us and another for just the guys of the circle.

I have felt like a tag along ""just there"" kind of person and I dont feel like anybody really talks to me directly or ever wants to do anything with me so am wondering how youd detach yourself from these people in my situation? 

Would you mute the groups and just never read the messages or just leave the groups how they are and just not bother replying to any messages you get asking ahy you left etc? 

Sounds like such a childish situation but I cba to deal with their confrontation of it because it is just a mood kill


Thanks and sorry",1
149,"(Long post, main question at the bottom.) My friend is showing a lot of hatred. She’s insulting me and my friend and I don’t know how to stop it.","Okay so- this is going to get very confusing because I’m shit at explaining things. Im gonna be venting a lot because overtime this has gone from making me sad to making me angry. It’s also really late and my brain tends to stop working when I need to be sleeping. Anyway, let’s start with some backstory. 

Approximately 2 or 3 weeks ago I had a fight in my group chat with someone. In this group chat we have three main protagonists and some side characters that don’t really make that many appearances. We have me, my friend Husk and my other friend Cotton. Cotton got incredibly offended and had an unnecessary fight with me and Husk in the group chat that made me uncomfortable and went on for way too long. I tried to stop it but I didn’t know how because I don’t know how to set boundaries and that’s on me. Cotton then left the group chat. She’d done it in the past, but this time it made me incredibly unhappy and irritated.

Let’s fast forward a few days. I talked to Cotton one on one and we both apologised. Afterwards, she started dumping a lot of stuff on me that I wasn’t ready for. She explained that she thinks Husk doesn’t care for her at all, and that getting attention in the group chat was like a fight. That made me really sad because I knew she was feeling left out and I tried my best to make her feel welcome but it never seemed to work, obviously. She then started getting very aggressive, she wasn’t trying to be subtle anymore and eventually she just started to blatantly cuss out Husk and get angry about everything she did. She shipped these two characters? Irritating. She decided to scrap some characters she made? What a selfish thing to do. It felt like everything that Husk did made Cotton mad, even if it made Husk happy. I would literally take a bullet for Husk, so hearing this made me very angry. I also always thought friends supported you if you had a passion but Cotton proved me otherwise. Speaking of which, she wasn’t very subtle about hating my passions either. I love Oliver Tree, I will never stop loving him and his music, but Cotton absolutely hates him. Why? He vapes. How terrible. At first she wasn’t mean or rude when expressing her dislike for him, and I understood it. You don’t have to like everything I like if you’re my friend, we’re all different and we all have our own tastes, but eventually Cotton started hating on him in a way that made me feel embarrassed that I liked him. I changed my profile picture to a gif of his Hurt music video and she commented that he was a spazz. I didn’t even know what that meant but I still changed my profile picture because it made me feel embarrassed. I’m not the only one either, Husk said that she also felt embarrassed when Cotton commented on what she liked.

Anyway, TL;DR, she confessed a lot of hate towards us and opened my eyes about the things she did that made me feel crummy.

Now let’s jump another few days to about three days ago. An old friend of mine, Davey, joined our group chat again. She was gone for a very long time and I was absolutely ecstatic. She was also a long time friend of Cotton’s, I have no idea how long they’ve been friends for but their relationship outlasts mine by a long time. Davey noticed that Cotton wasn’t in our thriving group chat and decided that as her friend she’d invite her back. I think they may have been discussing this in private but again I’m not sure. Anyway, the problem with this is that I genuinely believed that Cotton was a toxic person and that I shouldn’t be talking to her. So, I kind of ghosted her. I admit that’s a bad thing and I shouldn’t have done it but I’ve always been advised to block or deleted someone from the internet that makes me feel uncomfortable. Now I was forced to interact with her again. I didn’t want to, I was petrified and didn’t dare to type a single thing into the group chat until someone else did. Eventually it turned into this mutual hate thing where we’d talk but very awkwardly and with few words. 

Today I was extremely sick. I’ve been sick for the last week and have done nothing but lay in my bed and watch TV, I haven’t even touched my computer at all. I found out not too long ago that a conversation took place where Davey expressed that no one was on and that we were all inactive. For this entire period Husk has also been reluctant to posting in the chat so she only talks if her friend, Inkie, talks. Cotton then took the opportunity to start bad mouthing us, and it really hurt. I’m going to try and quote her now because I don’t know how else to do this. This won’t be accurate..

Davey: AwW no ones on *something expressing her hurt*

Cotton: Don’t worry about those fuck-faces.

They’re never on when I speak so you’ll have to talk to them tomorrow or something.

Davey: okay.

*they then talked a bit*

Cotton: I appreciate your better-than-Epo's-and-Husk's-friendship.

Wtf does that even mean? I’m Epo, by the way. It’s a screen name. Anyway, how do I even respond to this. What to I do, do I ignore it or do I just apologise for not being on? 

This is my final question. How do I deal with this? Should I just make another group chat and try to leave them behind or do I confront Cotton? I just spoke to Davey and told her that what they said made me “feel sad after reading all that” but I haven’t gotten a reply. That just makes me more scared to confront them. I’m so scared that I’m going to do the wrong thing. I need advice, please. This is all so stupid and the fact that I have no idea what to do makes me feel insecure lmao.",1

475,"My neighbor and long term acquaintance is essentially a little bit of a pedophile, he had a child with a minor. Should I report him?","Hello, everyone, its my first time posting here, and honestly, I really just needed more than one person's advice about this. So here's the story, and its a long one:

My neighbor has always been a bit of a douche (lets call him ""Douche"", its just fitting). Since we were kids, he's always been this narcissistic, self centered brat that wants everything (typical stuff when you're a kid, he got mad once because a mutual neighbor had gotten a red Wii for Christmas and he had the regular white one, another time he forced his parents to get him a mini-motorcycle because one of our other neighbors had gotten one for Christmas, the works). Of course, as we got older, he naturally started wanting to date any girl whom was of his ""personal taste"" (essentially, it just breaks down to: Big Breasts + Big Butt = Mine, doesn't matter what kind of personality they have. What a surprise, right?), and he'd do anything to do so. The obvious route he was bound to take was the ""Flex"" route, so he'd aways try to flaunt his newest piece of gear (the newest iPhone, a plethora of ""Beats"" headphones that he and his older brother ((they're esentially clones, except the bro is tall and the others short)) would always abuse the warranty of and get twice as many pairs, etc.) To how ""unique"" he is (would constantly post pictures of random things he'd drawn with his set of expensive pencils, videos of him playing a set of high quality bongos he bought, and then left after about a month of using them, things like that). Of course, the girls he'd target would always fall for him, and he'd constantly be on and off with a handful of them, especially one girl, whom her parents essentially had to get a restraining order forced on both of them so they would stop seeing each other, it was pretty hectic. Of course, me being the extremely shy kid I once was, I was a bit jealous of him, in pretty much every aspect, he seemingly had this ability to make himself likable to everyone, and I had no idea how. 

Of course, time goes on, and we get older (he's 3 years older than me, so at this point I'm around 13-15 and he's 16-19), and this guy hadn't changed a bit, he actually got worse (I started to hang out less with him after this point, I just didn't like him as a person anymore), started to strut his Charger everywhere he went (even though he wouldn't have been able to afford it if it hadn't been for my dad helping his family out with his credit score) and of course, had this obsession with girls that for some reason were all under his age. The first time I noticed this happening was when we were both part of a mutual friends quinceanera (whom he also tried to get romantically involved with when we were younger, but didn't fall through with it due to his brother dating and later marrying the girls sister), and we had to get dance partners. He of course got paired up with the main girl because they were technically family at that point, I partnered up with the main girls cousin. But he had his eye on this one specific girl whom was also another cousin of the main girl, (we'll call this cousin ""M"" for simplicities sake) who was 13 while he was already 18. One day after about a week into dance practice, the girls were all stretching while the boys were talking in a circle, we get called over while the girls are still stretching, and the guy goes, ""Hey M, I like ladybugs a lot too."" Now at first, I just thought, ""Well that was random, why'd he say that?"" After further looking around, I see that her leggings were significantly thinner than other leggings, and we could see her ladybug print panties in full view. Even worse, M perfectly fit his ""Perfect Girl"" criteria, so it clicked in me about what was going on. As the month goes by, this girl is naturally falling for him (his ""nice guy"" facade, rides in his car to go get snacks for the group, constant snapchat messages, hugging and cuddling, ect.) but thankfully after the night of the party, she lost interest. 

Now fast forward to around last year, I'm 18-19, he's 21-22. He was able to weasel a job from his dad in the landscaping company he works for (his brother did the same), and is making great money (has 2 of the newest phones for no reason, constantly buys stuff from Craigslist and shows it off as if its new ((no problem with getting stuff from CL though, lying about it is the bad part)) the usual), he also went to the gym purely for cool points to be able to show off his arms (he only ever really did arm workouts, his stomach is technically bigger than mine when he isn't flexing it) with constant videos and ""photo updates"" on his Snapchat and Instagram of him running and posing. One day he seemingly stops posting altogether, not to mention seeing how we live next-door to each other, he started coming home super late from wherever he would hang out every day. Of course we just shrugged it off and assumed he was just being him. But around a half year later, it was something completely different.

   About a month and a half ago (he's 22 now, I'm 19) his mom (whom is great friends with my mom) comes by and drops off a plate of food (we're Mexican, its typical), and to show us a surprise. She shows my mom a picture of a  2 month old baby, and says that her little ""Douchey"" had a baby. Of course, my mom and I were shocked to see that, knowing how nonchalant Douche was with his relationships. I thought, ""Oh well, it was bound to happen one day, guy can't keep his dick in his pants when it comes to his type of girls"", and left the thought at a simple ""Yikes"". About a day later, we come to find out that the babies mother is 17. Immediately, that ""Yikes"" turns into a ""Fucking **Y I K E S**"", the guy essentially had sex with a 16 year old being 21. We learn the the mom is essentially part of a broken family from the next state over from ours (we're pretty close to the state border), has a mom that lives off of child support checks of her other 5 kids, had used drugs, the works of a trashy family. Supposedly Douche wanted nothing to do with his now baby-mama, and was just going to settle with seeing the baby once in a while. Soon after word got out of the baby, we assume his parents start to worry about potential news of the mother getting out to the neighborhood, baby-mama starts to come over to Douche's house and stay for around 3 days a week. Now we assume she basically lives there. At this point, I sorta felt like reporting him would be a lost cause (no evidence of the relationship being a thing), that is of course, before I got my hands on some proof. 

Douche of course went in immediately with his ""Egoistic Charm"" and swooned baby-mama off her feet with a spanking new iPhone 11 Pro Max (or whatever its called, I forget at this point), and naturally, he starts trying to flex with his girl. Now, I'm not saying that having intimacy in a relationship is bad, its actually great. But, those moments should REALLY be kept between the couple, and no one else. Of course, Douche LIVES for Snapchat, and decided to start posting very sexual things. First, he takes a video of him walking down a street with baby-mama in front, periodically stopping, slapping and grabbing her ass, and walking again. I was grossed out immediately, and of course thought, ""Why the fuck are you doing this Douche? Just why?"", which also put me on the fence to actually go through and report him. It was pretty much your typical gross comments and photos, ranging from ""My queen has the best ass ive ever seen."" to ""Those thighs are THE reason we ended up having a baby."" followed by a flood of cringy emojis. But the breaking point was with todays ""lovely post"", which included a couple of clips of him ""talking"" to his baby, ending with a picture of the baby feeding on baby-mama's breast, with his hand and a ""censoring"" emoji over the other. I cringed, and decided to show my mom for mutual cringing, and after a bit of closer looking, we saw that it wasn't the baby feeding, but Douche sucking on the girls boob while grabbing the other. My mom and I have been pretty queasy about it all day, and so I decided that enough was enough. I went to his snapchat story and took a photo of him suckling baby-mama using my old phone, so I thankfully have a bit of evidence if I were to go through with it, plus I can already tell that his relationship is purely powered by lust, and knowing the type of person baby-mama is, she'll probably leave him in a couple of months after sucking his wallet dry. Should I go on and try to report him somehow? I'd hate for him to try and go for some younger prey (his mom is our other next door neighbors 13 year old daughters god-mother, whom he's always been pretty close with ((hugging, carrying, sitting on his lap, things like that)), but the girl is pretty ""developed"" for 13, and is pretty much centimeters away from Douche's ""Perfect Girl"" criteria, and I'd hate to see if he goes and does something stupid with her).

What do all of you suggest though, is there even a way I could go through with my plan? Should I even go through with it? Any help is greatly appreciated, and hopefully we can get one more creep away from these girls. Please and thank you!",1

177,My anxiety is ruining my friendship,"Hi all,

Sorry for the extremely long post. Wasn’t sure where to post this but wanted some advice or maybe just to vent.

We’ve been best friends for probably 4 years now starting our 5th. About 2-3 years into our friendship, I (F, Bi, 28) fell for her (F, Straight, 31). We worked together and even shared our office. We would take lunch, go out after work, stay late, etc. What really caused me to have feelings were the sleepovers. She would sleepover at least once a week. She lived 15-20 minutes from work and so did I but in the opposite direction. The reason for the sleepovers were because we’d smoke and she’d get tired and fall asleep. We soon became inseparable. I quit the job and she followed suit not too long after and we went off to different jobs but continued our friendship as normal. She once said that she found it so bizarre when people would ask about our friendship as if we stopped seeing each other as often as we did when in reality, it’s like we never quit.

I told my best friend about my feelings and she was great. I was terrified that I was going to lose her as a friend but instead we talked it out and agreed that we didn’t want our friendship to change and keep it business as usual meaning, no time apart, keep hanging out, etc. At the time, I was in therapy and we had been working on telling my best friend. After I told her, my best friend and I were a little cautious and wanted to make sure that business as usual was a good thing. After discussing at length for many sessions, my therapist said that there was no need to create a distance and that at the end of the day, it didn’t take away from the fact that she was my best friend and one of my major support systems. 

Problem is: Sometimes, for no reason at all, I’ll feel like things are off or we’re disconnected. We text everyday and she calls me on the phone every night. The first couple times when she wouldn’t call me triggered this alarm of “what have I done?” I would start to panic and think that maybe she wanted distance from me and so I in turn would distance myself from her. 

It starts off as a no phone call from her. Then I wouldn’t get a text from her until about 3-4PM the next day. Things would be normal and then I’d be okay. Then something so ridiculous would set me off like once we had plans to see some a movie and she invited someone else. I took it as if she would have rather seen it with the other person but since I already knew about it, just had me come out of pity. Sometimes, I’m just jealous of her other friends replacing me. Another unwarranted fear. 

We don’t really argue, but rather, just kind of sit next to each other in this weird awkward silence and then just end the night. I have a hard time saying what bothers me and I’m always terrified that if complain or say what bothers me, that she’ll decide for me and say that we should stop hanging out. Also, I feel so stupid and ridiculous and immature for being upset over such small things. So instead of saying it, I just huff and puff in my head and shut down. After a week or two of no talking without explanation, I usually explain to her that I just needed time away because I was upset about whatever the trigger was.

When we had something like this happen last year, she said that when I stop speaking to her like that, it affects our friendship because it makes it seem like I harbor a ton of resentment towards her and that we’re not as close as she actually things we are. She gets frustrated when I don’t tell her what bothers me because it’s a convo that we have repeatedly and despite it all, I still don’t tell her how I feel when it’s the easiest thing to do. Shutting her out makes it feel like our whole friendship is at stake which is a horrible feeling for her because we’re inseparable in her mind. She gets frustrated because she gets to be the happiest and goofiest version of herself when she’s with me but I take that away when I’m upset. I never forgot about that. Since then, I’ve stopped doing that whole no talking thing because it is immature and I don’t want to take anything away from her just because I’m upset.

But now it’s back again and I can’t shake it. I was moving a few months back and was so overwhelmed with looking for a new place. Someone offered to help me and came with me to look at the apartments. I was bothered that she never offered to help until the last day. I wasn’t really in a talkative mood during the move due to the stress of it all and so she just took it as the move. Once I got settled in, she became busy at work. It had been about 3 weeks since we last saw each other, minimal phone contact. I texted her and some days she was more responsive than others. We still went out and saw movies or had dinner at least once a week but they were kind of quiet and awkward. We went to an event together and things were good until she went to hang out with other people and left me alone (albeit at my behest). On September 19, we went out to dinner and things seemed to be somewhat better. I had mentioned that our friend was going to Peru on her honeymoon. She said “yikes, I hope she’s not there when I’m there.” Puzzled, I said — “when are you going to Peru?” She said “October” and I said — oh, are we still going to Brazil like we planned? And she said yes. The reason I was so bothered was because in January she asked me to go with her to Brazil in October. As I started to get the funds, she said can we make it NYE instead. I said sure. In July, she said we’d have to postpone the trip because she didn’t have the money. So I said, no problem. So to casually find out that she was going away took me by surprise. I had expressed my frustration and she said that she bought the trip last August and wouldn’t tell me she couldn’t afford something then do it with someone else. She understood my disappointment but was looking forward to our trip. I let it go. This past Thursday, she told me she was excited for the trip. I asked her when she was leaving, she said Saturday. It just bewildered me that she bought these tickets in August 2018 and I’m really just getting details about it two days prior for two people who are “inseparable.” I’m trying not to be a jealous prick but its frustrating. At the same time, I feel like I’m the paranoid one who’s creating all this in my head. Right now, I feel like I pushed her away so many times by withdrawing and now she’s just moved on to other friends and it’s causing me to want to be distant from her.

TL; DR — I feel like I’m going to lose my best friend because my insecurities are manifesting and I’m creating arguments for no reason. I don’t want my anxiety to ruin this friendship. Tips?

959,My ex talking bad about me?,"So my ex and I broke up a year and a half ago, he cheated on me emotionally and ended up in a relationship almost immediately after ( I’m suspecting he cheated with his new girl as well as the girl that he admitted to cheating with, meaning he probably cheated on me with 2 girls). Anyways, from the vibe I got from his friends After the breakup, I know he has talked a good amount of shit. I travel a lot and would be gone for a couple months at a time. I understand now that that’s not sustainable for a relationship but I was 20 and liked the relationship. It went really south after we started fighting more and more, the traveling did not help. Anyways, even one of my old friends came into town and I saw on her social media she is hanging out with some of his friends. I know that she has heard some bad things about me at this point. I live in a small town so I can’t help but feel that everyone has heard some rumors he has spread. Maybe it’s my anxiety, but I feel like a lot of people in my town dislike me because of him now. He has a lot more friends than me, so he kinda has more power in his side of everything .",1

Well, this friend (let's call her Kat) likes a guy (let's call him Trevor) since we started high school. Yeah, for f***ing five years, we all have sixteen now. She even confesed to him in our first year, but Trevor never showed any interest in Kat.

So, I don't know why, but this year Kat has been talking about him A LOT, like she fell in love with him or something like that. Just two days ago, she was very happy because he invited her to play cards with him. They never were friends, or closed, and never talked too much, but Kat keeps saying they have now a ""connection"" because she feels that he is taking more interest in her.

All of her friends, incluiding me, think she is a little obsessed, and worst of all, I have to hear her planning to approach him. 

I feel selfish, but I don't want to hear more about Trevor. WHAT DO I DO????",1

They need to make at least a specific amount of hours and they fulfill those hours by making wishes.
A teacher, in charge of coordination, allocate courses between the teachers during a specific day (they call this day the market).

We live apart right now but usually are together every 4/5 out of 7 nights. The issue is that next year I’ll be done with college and we would be farther apart. It’ll get harder to see each other and more expensive. She wouldn’t be able to just walk over to my place across campus anymore. 

My GF has a hard time in college and leans on me on emotional support. I know that I won’t be able to pick her up all the time and all the money spent on Uber’s wouldn’t make sense.

Like, I go to work, ask colleagues I don't really know how their weekend was, like we're friends, only we're not, we're just co-workers for the same company. If I asked a stranger on the street how his weekend was, I'd be seen as weird. Yet because we work together it's fine.

Yet I don't know these people, not do I quite care how their weekend was, it's more pleasantries for no reason. If I left tomorrow no one would mourn or miss you really, you're not friends yet you have conversation like you are.

Days often feel unreal as I'm not really genuine, but I do it as it feels right. I can't think how to explain it, I guess days feel like a dream at times once I get home. I'm not sure how to overcome this.",1
633,My friends said that I would probably kill myself.,"So I spent last week with my friends in a house by the beach it wasn’t that great because I’m not into drinking or partying a lot but I wouldn’t say it was the worst week of my life.
But on the last day we were playing a game were everyone had to point to someone who they believe would do a certain thing, that’s when they asked who was more likely to kill them self and immediately everyone pointed at me.
It was heartbreaking that my friends who I told about the issues I had when I was dealing with depression did that to me it really broke me apart.
The next day I wrote in a group chat that we have how bad that made me feel and how suicide is not something we should treat that way but just 3 people out of 16 apologized the rest of them just ignored my message.
I don’t know what else should I do I don think a friend would do that so I don’t know if I trusted the wrong people and that really sucks to feel that way.
Do you think I should try to make them or understand or just let them go?
Thank you",1
680,Not sure what i want (?),"Ok so, i’m always attracted to the really hot and mysterious guys. The ones who are hard to pin down and get to open up. Then i say that i want a “real relationship.” Once i find someone who’s willing to have an emotional connection, i’m turned off. I want something thrilling and exciting but i also want someone reliable. I can’t have both. I had a weird “boyfriend” as a freshman in high school and then i dated my brother’s best friend but let’s be real, i just dated him because he was hot as hell. He ended up only wanting a physical thing. So what’s wrong with me?? Am i just immature? I can’t make up my mind :( i’m an 18 year old female if that helps.",1

216,I’m being outcasted!,Hello! I recently went through a breakup of someone I was with for a year. Like any breakup it was incredibly difficult because we are best friends and I felt so alone. After that happened I became close to this girl Katie who truly helped a lot with not being alone. This past Friday I went over to my friend Susan and her boyfriend’s apartment with another friend and we were all super drunk. At some points during the night my friend’s boyfriend put his hand on my back and then my shoulders very briefly. I was super uncomfortable about it especially since Susan was right there and watching it happen and I thought it was strange but didn’t want to say or do anything in front of everyone. Susan messaged me a bit later and asked if I thought he was being handsy. I said I noticed a bit and I felt uncomfortable but didn’t want to cause issues. She then said that it’s not me who caused any issues it’s her boyfriend and it’s not on you. Then all of a sudden later at night she messaged me super pissed telling me how I should have reacted in this situation. I expressed that when I’m uncomfortable I shut down and I truly dying want to bring up my discomfort in front of everyone. Yes in a perfect world I should have just gotten up and walked away I was just kind of shocked and just incredibly confused. She told me that reason is bullshit and it is easy for everyone to speak up in situations like that and to never talk to her again. Then my friend Katie who I have been for whenever she needs me told me that I’m untrustworthy because I receive and accept affection from men in relationships. I have tried to reach out to her with no success. I truly just don’t think it’s right to tell people how to react when they are uncomfortable and completely ostracize their for it. I feel so incredibly alone now and don’t know what to do. I feel like they have turned everyone against me and I have nobody left. I just need some advice!,1
87,I Think my (F23) friend (M24) is having mental problems,"Sorry for the broad text. My Friend, Nick, had a complete mental breakdown when his girlfriend left him. He lives in Las Vegas, I live in Wisconsin. He suddenly has become extremely religious, and is obsessively reading the bible, which, whatever, I'm not religious but to each their own. The thing is, he was never ever interested in religion before. He doesn't game, he doesn't watch T.V. he just reads the bible and plays on his guitar all day, according to him. He said he read something called ""The Seven Fires Prophecy"" and afterward he had '3 separate dreams, and heard 3 separate voices.' Which is concerning, but he hasn't heard them since, but openly says he wouldn't tell me if he *did* hear them again. Also, he doesn't go to church because ""They're all liars and they're trying to cover up what the bible really says to do."" 

Now, I don't mind religious people, he's actually very accepting of me, which is great, but I'm seriously concerned this is some sort of schizophrenia or something similar. His mother lost her marbles a long time ago too, and his brother is mentally disabled so he has some kind of family history. I just don't know what to do. He won't go to a professional because he ""Just won't"" (he wont elaborate as to why). 

I don't think he's a danger to himself or others, yet, but this really REALLY feels like some kind of break with reality. Any thoughts on this, reddit? I'd really rather be wrong about this but it's concerning me a lot.",1
466,I [15M] found out my friend’s [15M] cousin passed away.,"Victoria, Australia

I hadn’t seen my friend come to school since the start of term a week ago, so I asked him why and he just said, bluntly, “My cousin killed themself.”

He’s definitely taking it really hard as he mentioned that he doesn’t really feel emotions anymore after what happened. The school well-being team already plans on talking to him so I guess that helps.

What can I do to help him? What kind of small things would really help him move past a loss like this?

Lastly, generally speaking, are there any red flags that I should be wary of when someone is going through a hard time like this?",1
556,Possible identity theft. please help,"So I recently bought a phone online through a site that lets sellers list used phones for buyers. 

Usually the payments happen via PayPal and the seller ships the phone to the buyer. There was a listing that came up for a phone well below the average selling price and I pulled the trigger and bought it (payment was through the site using PayPal)

In my case, the seller of the phone I bought lived close by so I asked if we could meet in person after the PayPal payment went through. 

He agreed and we met in front of a cell phone store. He asked to see my Id, which I thought was normal so he knew I was the buyer, but then he took a picture of my id next to the phone I was buying. 

I asked him why he took the photo and he said it was because when buyers meet in person they sometimes take the item and then report the seller for non shipment to get a refund via PayPal. I thought this made sense and carried on

as I was looking over the phone he mentioned he worked at a certain cell phone store nearby. Again, I didn’t think anything of this information and continued inspecting the phone.

We parted ways after we agreed we were both satisfied.

But as I was driving off it hit me that my DL has like all my info and I just let some rando take a photo of it.

Being paranoid, I looked up the guy online and didn’t find too much. He did have other previous listings for phones on some site called 5miles. But not much else 

I did however find out that we had a previous criminal record. Idk what the nature of it was but this sounded some alarms for me.

I texted the guy later and asked if he could please delete the photo since the transaction was compete and I had confirmed with the site that I had received the phone. He said he would. But again it’s just his word I can’t be sure he actually did.

I went even further and contacted the store he said he worked at ... but to my surprise they said no such person worked there. 

I’m super conflicted about what might’ve happened here. The guy seemed a bit sketchy and the fact that he lied about where he worked and has a criminal record alarms me.

I don’t have a lot of info on him other than his full name, city of residence, and selfie photos from his seller profile and twitter. 

Has anyone had their DL info stolen before? What could someone possibly do with that info and what can I do to prevent it

I’ve looked online and it seems like I should report this to the police but I don’t want to accuse someone of a crime either. Should I just report it as lost? 

And assuming I do get a new DL and DL number, could someone use my old number to open accounts or impersonate me?

Any advice or help would be of great help",1

427,A fork in the road... what should I do??,"I really don't know what to do at this point in my life, I have come up with two options that both have their pro's and cons, I really need help deciding as this can be a potentially life changing decision, I need serious responses only. I work a full time job right now, but know that I do not want to do this for the rest of my life, I want to finish school ( 25 y/o Male ) and have a change of pace, I feel like this constant stagnation and repetition is giving me depression, even though I shouldn't be depressed because I am blessed for what I do have. 

Option One

Stay here continue my full time job finish community college and attend a state university while still working. The University I will attend will be in the state, ( maybe that will be a change of pace ?)

Pros 

-Free Rent
-Practically no bills 
- Close to girlfiend ( although she said she would move with me ) 
-Help from parents with school related finances 
-Being Close to family 
-Higher Wages 
- Free Community college ( Although I can always finish here and then move) 
- The ability to keep saving alot of money 

Cons 

-Being Stagnant and having no change of pace 
- Feeling depressed because of repetition 
-keeping this full time job which has good pay, but is run by some really unfair and cruel people
- Being stuck in the place i grew up in for the rest of my life, dealing with the over population, pollution and other issues that people encounter in metropolitan areas 



Option 2: Move to las vegas ( a state away from me ) start a new life, find a temporary job while trying to get my guard card, be a resident for a year until I apply to UNLV ( University of Nevada Las Vegas) and finish schooling and then move back to where I am from. 

Pros 

- A change in pace, a new job, a new enviroment, new friends in a exciting city 
- Potentially good job working in security 
- A chance to go to the school ive always wanted to go to, after a year of working hard 
- A chance to learn to be more responsible and live on my own, pay bills and try to make it on my own 


Cons

- Lower Wages then where I live now 
-Having to pay Rent 
-Having to pay for some bills 
-far but not too far from family 
-Not being able to save as much money 
-Not knowing anybody at all 
- I like to gamble, but I have control over myself 



I have a considerable amount of money saved right now and have really been considering this, I want to move but should I? Should I stay? what should I do, My family told me I could come back, Im seriously considering moving after I get my affairs in order, help me decide please.

Here's everything we do not have: \*good-\*paying jobs, malls, chain restaurants/stores, movie theaters, bowling alleys, mini-golf, watersports that require a motor-vehicle, stores other than grocery stores, car dealers, gas for under $5/gallon, restaurants outside the fast-food/local-Hawaiian variety, an annual carnival, businesses that don't nickel and dime you cause they have a virtual monopoly, a *good* college, and a viable market to start a business.

I've been sick of living here for years, and I plan to move out and get an associate's in business on Kauai, which is where I used to live, and a place that has all the stuff I listed that Molokai doesn't have.

399,An old friend became a stalker,"First time poster looking for some serious advice.

On a game a couple years back i met this person (we’ll call him george) and we very quickly became friends after finding we shared a last name and other interests. George was always trying to call me and message me when i wasn’t online, and became angry when i didn’t reply. At first it was weird but no one else liked playing that game with me so i stuck by him. A couple months later and it got out of hand and i cut ties, we played on the same server so i asked admins to keep him away from me and all that. I was young at the time and felt a little bad but i ultimately had no other choice. 

After a couple weeks i met someone else who told me a similar thing happened with him and George and i was blown away, i stopped playing the game entirely just to avoid him. When my birthday came around George found me on facebook and offered steam gift cards, as a dumb kid i accepted and we became friends again. It was going real good we started playing all kinda games together on xbox, we had similar names and we even game shared. George continued being weird and i had to stop talking to him once more which only led to him getting extremely aggressive on xbox and messenger, calling me non stop and spamming messages. I again found someone who had similar experiences with george and even claimed his account was permanently banned by him. This person also claimed George was a pedophile even though George said he was 17 or so( i recently found out he was 20 at the time).
I didn’t completely cut ties with him in fear of losing my account which i had for a very long time and spent a lot of money on, i kept him at a distance for years and he’s been horrible the whole time saying that we are brothers but quickly calling me the worst person in the world for not playing games with him. 

I need some advice on what to do next, i didnt wanna make this post too long so if you have any further questions about things he has done ill be sure to answer.

So the background to this story: tomorrow me and my flatmates are going out. Only two of them wanted to go out, though, and I wanted more people to come, so I asked people on my uni degree course and three of them are coming with us tomorrow.

The problem? My life is a complete trainwreck, and the way I've managed it is by telling different social circles I have different parts of my mess, so that I can get advice and support for it, but no one knows all my mess and no one thinks I'm insane.

The people coming tomorrow are from different parts of my life entirely and have never met. My flatmates know about my drug problem and why I'm making everyone go out tomorrow (it's the one year anniversary of my best friend's death so I want to be wasted), and my coursemates know about how I've been sleeping with my ex-teacher (not anymore though! Which I'm sure they'll ask me about and expose me to my flatmates) and my eating disorder.

I'm scared that they'll mention these things in front of each other and realise that I'm too much to handle and stop being friends with me. To counter this I'm making sure that pre-drinks are as short as possible to try and stop them from having time to compare notes, but my anxiety is still telling me that tomorrow is going to ruin my social life.

Should I panic? Am I overreacting? Should I ask them beforehand to not mention my mess in front of each other, or will that just make them more curious?",1

To put it shortly, I wanted us to do more activities in smaller groups/just us two and he doesn't want that. He claims that these more personal settings don't do much for him and he'd rather spend time in bigger friend groups. He doesn't want to sacrifice his well-being and fun for me, that's how he puts it basically. It's the exact other way around for me, unfortunately. I really don't enjoy the loudness and superficialness that comes with meeting in a group of 8+ people.

The argument lasted way longer than necessary and I got pretty bitter at some point. We haven't spoken in about two weeks now but we're not on bad terms or anything. This whole time I'm trying to see the situation from his perspective but I'm honestly struggling to see his point. Knowing him, I'm certain that he's not just lying about not wanting to be my friend. He really does appreciate me, I know that. But is this a real thing? Are there  people out there that actively avoid being in small group settings like that? Is this an Extrovert - Introvert thing?

She came over last week for us to binge watch our fav show and half the time she was on the phone and the other half she was sleeping so we didn’t really hang out. She’s also not the type of person to be on the phone while she’s with anyone. I know that is the case when she isn’t texting back when they’re hanging out, but she will open my texts and not say anything for hours. If you have time to open my texts and read it you can reply. I just miss my best friend. How do I tell her this without sounding like a needy friend :D",1

541,Should I Switch to an MFA,"Hello, 

I'm a poet of mild-renowned in my local scene. Besides my partner, it is the only thing I love in life. It brings me incredible levels of joy, and some people seem to think I'm not half bad at it. The problem is this, I'm half-way through my MSW and I fucking hate it. I thought I was making the responsible decision, and choosing something practical, but it's a battle to finish things at this point. If I don't flunk out, there's a possibility this degree could get me a stable job that doesn't take too much of my time, and I can focus on poems. Then again, I could drop-out, work like a dog, focus on my poetry career in my free time and get into an MFA program. So far I have a 4.0, but I don't think that's gonna last past this semester, and I have no debt, but my savings are completely gone. I'm 25. My parents aren't good at talking about this kind of stuff with me, and I really REALLY need some advice.

Thanks,

153,How do I politely say ‘you’re wasting your time by asking me something I don’t know’ to a customer?,"I work at Papa John’s and there’s about four in my city (one shares the same street as us, ""Levy Ave"") and one an hour ago by car at another city (the only one I know of that covers where we don't cover).

I totally understand that people WILL get confused between the two PJ that are on the same street if they order online and I usually just ask ""Are you sure you ordered with us? Your name doesn't pop up."" Unfortunately that isn't met with kindness sometimes and I get told ""No, I'm PRETTY sure it was here.""

No. It. Isn't.

I got a call last week for a delivery that was out of our 'zone' and the person kept asking if I knew the address or phone number (I just knew it was on Main Street, ironically the closest one to them) and I kept saying no as I barely knew of its existence until a few weeks ago and even then, this was the first person that insisted that I should tell him. He then asked me if I could search it up...you know the rest, no phones allowed and I don't know anything outside clocking in and putting in orders.

He wasted 30 seconds, it seems a whole lot more in retail and such, when he could've just easily searched it up in less than 10.

Point is, how could I say ""stop being dumb and just google it instead of wasting a 30 seconds of your time especially WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE OUT"" without getting a complaint of being rude or giving attitude even if said in the nicest way possible.",1

Then he tried to get into my moms and dads.  An hour later after calling the cops i go to look in my car. The center compartment was open and the contents (mostly trash and a birthday card) were on the passenger seat. As in was searching the cops show up.  Since no valuable items were missing, we didnt make a report.  He took my playe number and info.  Now 2 hours later I sit paranoid he has am atm recipet of mine.  It doesnt have any personal info of mine except for my account number and balance.  However my badge for work with my face and first name is on it. Am I making my self worried for nothing or should I panic?

I had nice sunglasses and a prescription along with a portable speaker in the glove box. But it was all untouched. I also hace a ton of spair change, i dint know the exact amount, but it didnt look like he took much.  My car is totally full of trash, and he was quick to check other cars.  The only valuable things in the car werent touched. And only one compartment appeared open.  I set my account limit to $20 so if he uses it ill be notified.  All he has if anything is an account number and first name.  Can he steal my identity? Also if hes doing this so fast is he going to remember a name and what account it goes to?

845,My brother [21] has very negative thinking patterns. He’s a NEET who still lives with my parents and locks himself in the room while refusing to talk to anyone. I’m afraid he might hurt other people.,"My brother is EXTREMELY sensitive or depressed. He doesn’t like any negativity in the slightest. I’ve read his diary and he uses the term “the walking dead” to refer to people who live to survive not to make a difference. So I’m assuming people who go to school to major in what they hate to get a job they hate then work until they’re dead. And he holds grudges against people for things most people wouldn’t. In his diary he said anyone who ever crossed him (he listed names my sister and dad were on it) would “bask in his glory”. At first I found that very alarming. But then later in the same entry said that he had the ability to be a compassionate human being and make a difference so I backed off...like okay maybe that was just poor phrasing . HOWEVER this was a year ago and since then my brother has stopped talking to everyone. I sent him emails but he told me to stop messaging him. But he DID wish my mom a happy 50th but other than that. Nothing. Before he retreated in his hole he’s  admitted to my mom and sister that he’s hurt and that he won’t talk to any of us until my dad is out of the picture. Because my dad used to be very toxic and I guess that took a toll on him. My dad is a lot better but my brother loves to hold grudges. He also called my dad a “demon”. He has a car. And I know he hangs out with a good kid that I know. But that kid is kind of weird too, lol. Anyways, I can’t help but feel wary of him. Even my sister said he was the type to kill someone for a “good cause”. I pressed her on it and she said he would probably be the type to kill the rapists or pedophiles of the world. To be honest I guess I’m afraid he’ll hurt other people. He’s been in the military and has gotten a misdemeanor for charging $800+ on this guy’s debit card because he was a racist. He refuses therapy. And we can’t force him because he’s an adult. He did go once with my dad and they said that he’s a very negative person. Which I find ironic. What should I do...because my brother is not very disciplined. So I feel like things will get worse for him before they get better and by then I think it’ll be too late. I’m 18.",1
795,I think everybody deserves to be listened including me. I need some outsider view on this.,"I usually keep things to myself but when there is too much on my plate I venture out to complete strangers for advice as I don't feel comfortable sharing it with anyone in my friends and family.

Getting to the point, I feel like I do speak to my boyfriend and tell him what I feel is right or wrong or just anything in general. But I feel like he doesn't listen to me. Last night we both got a little too tipsy and he took me to a deserted mall nearby. The purpose was to roam around and get sober before returning home as both our families will kick us out if they find out we drink. Anyways, so it was a mutual decision to go to the mall and sit or just wander around for a while. 

A little bit of back story is required here. We have been fighting and had arguments before this meeting happened. The coldness was present from my side during the meeting as well. I had told him just one thing to not do. To not touch me inappropriately when we meet. When I get angry/upset, that's one of the things which I tell them, don't touch or don't talk. It's just who I am I can say. 

So if you can expect, we went to the mall and I was very drunk and wanted  to sit on the floor at some point. He picked me up, made me stand and kissed me. Not once or twice. Repeatedly he smooched me in the corridors of the mall even after I told him to stop at the end. Before we left and parted for our homes I asked him, why did you kiss me when I had warned tou against touching me? He said it was a mistake and I did stop when you told me to stop. 


I agree, he did stop but only for that moment, after a while he started again. 

I live in a third world country where smooching in public is looked down upon. The mall where we went us very near to my home. This is to give you some perspective.


What I want to know after stating all these is, am I not good at communicating or he just fails to listen to me?

This is not the first instance this happenend. It has happened a lot of times before as well.",1

558,advice is appreciated,"This is gonna be incredibly long. I’m sorry i’m advance. 

Okay so, to begin, i am a bisexual female.

A couple months ago i learned that a friend i liked was into me too. She’s also a girl and bisexual. We’ll call her B.

Me and B expressed our feelings for each other and decided we’d start talking. Since then, me and B have been on some dates and had some sleep overs. We have never done anything sexual, or even kissed for that matter.

Since things were getting kinda serious (i guess?), i came out to my parents. The reason i had never done this before is because, well, i didn’t think it was necessary. I had never been in a relationship with a another girl before and never thought i would be, so i considered me coming out as bisexual irrelevant. 

When i did come out, i told my parents i was talking to B. They took it fine. Of course it was a change and it threw them off a bit, but they were fine about it. B had come out to her parents a while ago and is pretty much openly bi. She told her parents about me as well. We’re pretty much a thing.

So, here’s my issue.

There’s this boy. We’ll call him A. I’ve known A for years. At least 5. We’ve been best friends since. Well, kinda. When freshman year came, we drifted apart. As many friends do. We didn’t have any classes together and rarely saw each other. We struggled to keep a connection, so we stopped talking. It made me super sad and i thought about him all the time. I wanted to reach out, but my pride wouldn’t let me. 

This year, we have two classes together. Needless to say i was super excited to have my best friend back. We reconnected very quickly and text all day every day, about anything really. But i’ve come to realize that i like A more than a friend. Did you see this coming? Haha. 

I’ve liked him for the longest. It’s one of those things you know is there, but never speak of or act on. He asked me out once years ago and has confessed his feelings to me before. But like a dumbass, i never really responded. i don’t really know why.

i know he likes me, i know i like him. 

i just can’t stop smiling when i’m around him. He makes me laugh harder than anybody else. We connect, in a way i’ve never connected with someone before. We’re always together, even if we’re apart. He’s helped me through the toughest times. I don’t know what i would do without him.

On the other hand, my relationship with B is very different. We don’t talk on a daily basis, which is fine, i guess.. She doesn’t use her phone or social media much. But when we hang out we have a great time. We don’t really talk about MY issues. I’ve met her parents and they’re amazing. Her entire family is beautiful and welcoming, and so is she. I just feel like the connection isn’t quite there. The way it is with A at least.

But i’ve already come out to my parents and made things serious. I’ve already established a relationship with this girl. Just to throw everything away for some boy? Imagine what my parents would think of me, or her family. Would she be okay? i don’t want to lose her friendship. A doesnt even know about B. Ive never even told him that i’m bi. As a matter of fact, very few people know about B or my sexuality at all. I haven’t even told A that i like him or established anything with him. Would we even work out? Would it be worth it?

I just don’t know what i should do.
Any ideas would be so greatly appreciated.

And before you may ask or bring up, no, i am not ashamed of my sexuality. I read this over and it kinda seems like it huh? But i’m pretty comfortable with myself. i just don’t think it should be that big of a deal you know?

Anyway, thank you for taking time to read this if you did. Like i said, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1

I can’t afford a new place right now because I live in an expensive area and barely have a savings for a security deposit, first months rent, and last months rent. I need a roommate and have been looking for one through various resources but everything seems fruitless. Also, my dog is afraid of people so he’s been a hard sell what with all the barking at potential new roommates.

I don’t mind living in my car and it would be easy (I thru-hiked the AT so I have an idea of what to expect) for a couple months while I save up money for my own place. The problem is I have my beloved dog and I can’t get rid of him. I’ve thought about it, but loosing him after all we’ve been through would push to taking my own life.

I don't even know the first place to start at this point, because schools like UTK  are way out of price range and I probably couldn't even get in academically.

70,"I lost my best friend cause i was too annoying? (Long Story, but please help)","Some background on the topic. Me and my (now ex) best friend have been friends since 7th grade (we're  both sophomores now). During this summer I took her to California with me and my family to go see some more of my family (we're from the midwest). Money isn't the issue here rn but to reference, all she had to pay for was her plane ticket (300$), and any personal items she wanted to buy while we were there. My grandma bought her and me universal studios tickets for christmas/my birthday (same day). Trip was great, a dream really, me and her never fought. Everything is great afterwards until school is back. 
She's hanging out with all her volleyball team members, not a problem for me I was cool with them. She doesn't talk to me as much but i knew she was a busy person. But then the topic of homecoming was coming up. Me and my friends scramble to see who's all going in a group together and i assume the my best friend (let's call her Rose) is going with me and my other friends. so we make a big group chat, and we add everybody that is going in our group. so we add Rose of course, And everything is fine for a few days. But then apparently she isn't going with us. I got really sad and mad because she decides to go with someone that I do not like. So I go up to her locker and ask her who she's going with because I'm sick of everyone going back-and-forth. she says she's going with the person I don't like because she asked first. What the heck does that mean is what I first thought. So then I start getting mad and I'm like whatever I'm not going anymore then. And Rose starts texting me being like I'm sorry but she asked me first. Rose had just broken up with her boyfriend so before I thought she was going with him, but she was with the girl I do not like right after she broke up with him. So she had all this time to figure out who she was going with and then she text me ""oops i double booked myself"". i'm instantly heartbroken, i'm done with her. i text them (Rose and this one other girl who followed her) that i'm done with them. I'm a very ""in the moment"" person and decide i don't need them. It's been a few weeks, a lot of drama has gone down and Rose and the other girl keep telling people i'm a druggie and i'm poor cause my dad can't get a job because he's an alcoholic. What should I do? I really miss Rose, but she has been so mean to me and texted me she doesn't care about me anymore. i'm fine with not being friends with her anymore, but i just want them to stop taking shit about me. Rose keeps texting me though every platform of hers and her brothers that she always thought i was annoying and she was confused on why i was upset she chose someone else over her best friend, Please help before i resort to killing myself.",1

673,"general stress / fear, lack of people to talk to","hi guys. for the recent years ive noticed a spike in what is simply just stress and fear/worry about irrational things, whether it's social, academic, or something else. 

examples include:

-	what if i get a bad grade on this assignment (with literally anything graded, regardless of it's bearing weight on my grade)
-	what if shortly after i go to my room [family member] chokes on something and i could have prevented it (happened today, guess who didnt go to their room for essentially half an hour)
-	what if i locked my dog outside and she feeezes to death and im responsible (has never happened with a single pet yet i still check two to three times)
-	what if these people i dont know who are laughing or talking quietly are making fun of me (most common)
-	what if someone is watching me / going to harm me (happens when im alone downstairs brushing my teeth if it's like past 8 / dark)

there's a ton more but i hope that covered most of the topics.

and these are common problems in my day-to-day life. i've lost sleep over them, i've isolated myself from social events over them. it's just some looming sense of worry that just flies over my head all day, and all the sudden im like struck with lightning and the next 10 minutes of my life is obsessing and stressing over something similar to whats in the above list.

im afraid to talk to my friends because i've done it too much. im afraid to talk to my school counselor because i kept going so often she quit calling me down (and it could be she forgot but idk). i'm afraid to talk to my family doctor because it might be nothing and i waste their time.

problem is i've basically made it so the only person im not afraid to have help me is myself. it dont work

an example of how this affects my day to day life in which it wouldnt anyone elses:

-	i once did this thing where you link something to your snapchat and your friends can send anonymous messages. you read them and respond to them on your story.
-	i did one ~5 months ago and this stress and fear is the reason i have yet to open it. the content of the messages and the amount scares me, as, being anonymous, it's a reflection of what people think of me.
-	i've deleted the app, gone to measures so i would never accidentally open it, etc etc. i've tried to open it, but i physically can't. i actually hover my finger over the app but my body is like pushing myself back and i feel sick about it every day and its a constant stress and fear


another example:

-	the last time i talked to anyone about this was when i vented (aka had a crisis) on my snapchat. it was a lengthy vent, yet i still posted it. it took me forever just staring at the ""send to"" screen to push ""my private story"" and send. i instantly shut off snapchat, turned off notifications so i wouldnt be aware of who is texting me abt it (if anyone) and went to sleep (was 2am)
-	i was off snapchat all of tomorrow. sent streaks normally, except covering the ""recent snaps"" portion of the send to screen (below your best friends) so i wouldnt see whos texted me.
-	i refrain from talking to my friends or anyone abt it. it was a low point for me.

can anyone help tell me how to move on past these fears? i havent spoken with any professionals (minus a school counselor 3 times in the span of 2 weeks), but its unlikely its a product of depression as far as im aware. i dont have any diagnosed illnesses or disorders. it's just stress and fear constantly. i just dont want them to keep affecting my day to day life.",1

976,I’m a junior in high school and my parents want me to go into a major I don’t enjoy or have expertise in. How can I approach them about this?,"I’ve been working towards being an illustrator since sixth grade. I want to be a concept artist or character designer, but more specifically I want to be a comic book illustrator. My parents have been *very* supportive of me my whole life, and have been saving up a college fund for a while now that I can use (which I am extremely grateful for). They’ve always been a little reluctant towards me going into an art school, but have never been against me going into an art major.

We were just talking in the car, and I was looking through emails I’ve been getting from some colleges. My parents asked if I’ve been looking into the colleges that’ve been emailing me, and I said I’ve been looking at the ones with illustration programs.

My dad asked why I haven’t been looking at graphic design programs instead, since they want me to major in graphic design. I told them I want to do illustration, I don’t like graphic design and none of what I do aligns with a major in graphic design. Now we’re trying not to argue about it so we can enjoy our trip, but I’m on the verge of tears. 

All the art I do is traditional. I’m exceptionally poor at creating logos or box designs because I don’t have an ounce of inspiration for it. I’ve been dreaming of working for a video game or comic company my whole life, and every job involving graphic design is something I don’t care about. I don’t like architectural or industrial design, but I understand that those jobs are much more practical. 

How can I convey to my parents that I have no expertise in the fields that graphic design uses? I’m willing to learn, but I know I won’t be happy. I want to talk to them about this later but I feel hurt and confused, and I have no idea what to do.",1

444,My girlfriend has suicidal thoughts: what should I do?,"My lovely girlfriend (F22) of 10 months and best friend has some mental health problems like depression and an eating disorder. She is not on medication, but she does go to therapy and a psychologist. I don't know how often she sees them.

Now to the main point: Today she asked me if I could stay with her today (stay as in talk to her, be there for her etc, we're currently long distance and live 5 hours apart with airplane). I asked her what has happened, and she told me that she had been fighting her suicidal thoughts all night. I interpret this as she wanted to kill herself, she had an ""urge"" to do so because she didn't want to exist, but she fought to resist the thoughts.

Now I'm really worried, because if your suicidal thoughts are so strong you have to fight them, it's pretty serious.

I should add that this is not the first time she expressed suicidal thoughts, and she has attempted suicide several more than once in her life.

I'm gonna call her soon and we're gonna talk about it. I will do my best to remain calm, but I'm honestly so scared. What if she does something to herself while I'm at work or sleeping?

The advice I came here for is basically what to do next. Should I tell her to do something? Maybe ask her talk to her parents (she lives with them), call her psychologist, or something else? Keep in mind that we're long distance, so I can't be there physically to prevent her from doing anything.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My long distance girlfriend told me that she was up all night battling suicidal thoughts. I'm really worried about her but don't know what to do next to prevent a suicide attempt from happening. She has depression and an eating disorder, but she is not on medication. She's in therapy  and sees a psychologist (I don't know how often).What should I do to help her for real?",1

5,I didn’t sign up for shared custody of a dog.,"About a month ago I was approached by an elder in my community and was asked if I would adopt her dog. I don’t know her personally, but have interacted with her through work. I clearly impressed her because this dog is her world. She’s had him since puppy, for almost ten years. She doesn’t have a lot else going for her and is VERY attached to this animal, which I get. I adore all of my pets and I treat them very well. 

That being said, I’ve had this dog for three weeks now, and things have gotten weird. The first day I had him, she called me after only 6 hours to see how he was doing. Then she told me (after she sent me with three huge bags of dog stuff) that she had just remembered that he has a chair that’s just his at her house, and asked me to come get it so he could have it to sit in. I politely declined and let her know that I have a lot of furniture for him to choose from. I told her I would call her with an update later. 

I called her about a week after that and let her know that he was settling in nicely. She told me that the day before she had spent the whole day crying. I wasn’t sure what to say about that so I told her that I understand and that I would take very good care of him and got off the phone.

Now for the concerning part, she just called me again, clearly VERY intoxicated. She was slurring her speech, and it’s not  even 1:30pm. She told me how sad she is and asked what I planned to do with the dog when he died. That she would like him cremated and she wants his ashes back when he goes.

Now, I work in a funeral home, I get grief. She’s a sad old lady who gave up her only friend and is having a hard go, I get that. However, when I agreed to adopt this animal, I didn’t think I was adopting her also. The direction in which this relationship is going is making me uncomfortable, and I’m not sure how to deal with this. It’s clear I need to set up boundaries but wtf do I say?? I really don’t want to dodge her calls, that seems cruel, but I also don’t want to have to tell her that she needs to take it down a few notches and hurt her feelings. Thoughts??",1

Now this guy was literally my best friend and we had a great relationship but he wasn't the same religion as me so my parents did not approve. 

The guilt of disappointing my parents (they literally called me a disappointment) and losing someone I loved deeply really weighed on me.  The general advice I got from everyone around me was 'invest that energy back into your studies!! :)))' and I did that which led me to burn out. 

Studying was a great distraction but now I have no motivation to do anything, I cry multiple times a day, I feel so alone it hurts, I miss him so much. I feel like I'm going crazy and I no longer feel like myself-- which is scary because i was always so sure about who I am. It's been 8 months, am I dumb for letting a breakup make me feel this way?

102,"Chose the wrong major, realizing this my sophomore year. Can anyone help?","I’m currently studying biology at a STEM based college. I chose this major in high school because I wanted to learn more about the sciences, as It’s never been my strong spot. I’ve been struggling really badly the past year. My first semester brought my GPA down really low, so I took some less math/science heavy classes my second semester (public speaking, writing and the environment, etc.) and my GPA was tripled. Now, I’m retaking two classes I failed my first semester along with some other gen eds. 
I realized that I lost my passion for this. I’ve always excelled in English, and I’ve always wanted to be a teacher, but I didn’t do it because I thought it was stupid in comparison to being a biologist. (My whole family is pushing me to pursue a major with better paying jobs. I want to be happy with my career, though.) 
My main problem is that, I have to transfer colleges since my college only offers stem majors. I’ve applied to a college that offers childhood education. I feel that I would excel in that major and I would enjoy my courses more. However, my GPA is not good. I currently have a cumulative of 1.8. But this is because I do not understand my classes and I’m simply not passionate about this. I put in my application, but there’s no opportunity to write an essay or anything. I’m planning on speaking with the transfer counselor about this, but I’m not sure how much she could do. I know my chances are slim. I also applied to a community college so that I could finish two years and then transfer. Any advice? Thanks!

488,I (23M) mad at my bestfriend (23M) after he got into his first ever relationship.,"First time posting here so please bear with me :)

Me and my bestfriend have been bestfriends from the past 14 years. We look after each other's backs. We are like brothers. 

He recently got into a relationship with this girl (22F), and since this is his first ever relationship I understand that he wants to spend more time with her than me. 

Things started going downward spiral when he himself changed as a person. He changed the way he dresses, changed his hairstyle, only goes to expensive restaurants now, attitude issues, bragging, and so on.....

You can really tell the way he props himself, I just don't understand how does she not see it? It's clearly a act. Although, this is not my business so I'll leave it here. 

That being said, from the day he got into the relationship, he barely meets me (we meet every weekend), never picks/returns my calls, doesn't check my messages (sometimes leaves me on read), and kicked me off of his priority list. I don't understand his motive. 

He spends the whole week with her, and still doesn't have the time to talk/meet with me. Is it too much to ask? 

Also, we were supposed to meet two weeks ago, and I called him to remind him about that and he tells me that he's out with his girl shopping so he won't be able to make it in time. I was pissed off so I stressed on our plans, and he told me that I'm no more his priority and cut the call. We haven't talked to each other from then on.

Small description of the people..... 

Bf- 22, lead of our group. Knows everything in our department that even our boss wouldn’t know or understand. 

Me- 23, the first to join our team. Knows almost everything about our job tasks but lacks a bit in the computer aspect of it. 

Carl- 23, the first person I trained on how to do our job. Knows the basics of our job tasks but lacks on the computer aspect of it. 

Kim- 21, started her position along with Carl. Knows the basics of our job and knows more about the computer aspect of our position more than Carl. 

Sally- mid 40’s, has been close friends with our boss for YEARS now. Considered like the “funny mama bear” of our team and in her previous team. Was working in another department and was the last to join our team. Knows the basics of our position but lacks with the computer aspect of it. 

Boss- mid 40’s, frequently forgets things but is a pretty cool dude 



      Okay so I work at a department store with my bf in a specific area in the store. Currently we’re a team of five. My bf is the full time lead of our team and I’m one of the full timers along with “Sally”. The other two associates, “Carl” and “Kim” are part timers. Recently, there’s been multiple occasions where Sally and I have fallen out. 
     The first time was when Sally, Kim, and I worked on this particular day. During the middle of the day I would tell Sally and Kim that WE SHOULD DO one of our particular tasks since it wasn’t as busy anymore.  I told them if we were to do it, then we wouldn’t have to deal with it later that day. They both didn’t seem like they wanted to. Later that day, our boss walked into the room and told me not to worry about it. Our boss told all of us in that moment that we could do it in a bit right after we finish the other tasks that were a bit more important. I acknowledged this and let it go. Once our boss left the room, Sally got in my face and kept repeating that she knew what she was doing, and that I didn’t have to tell her what to do because she’s been working here for a while. I didn’t really say anything in response, I was just surprised that she did that and I decided not to tell our boss since I figured this would be a one time thing. 
     The second time was the following day. I was in the room when Sally walked in. I said hello and I filed her in on what was going on since she had just started her shift. Instead of acknowledging what I said or saying hello back she proceeds to tell me in an annoyed tone that we weren’t going to do the thing I suggested to do yesterday. She said that she didn’t want to do it. She told me that our boss had told Sally and Kim that they were exempt from it. (That is what she got from the group conversation with our boss the day before) I replied saying, “No, our boss said that we do need to do it.” (We need to do it, BUT NOT NOW) After I said that she seemed like she wanted to call our boss right in front of me and prove me wrong. She kept smirking at me like if I was wrong and she was in the right. She proceeded to say that our boss told us that when we were done with everything we had to do for the day, then everyone could do what I suggested lasted time. I agreed with her because that is what our boss said. She then told me that this wasn’t what I said. She told me that I had told her she needed to do that particular task right now. I told her that I never told her to do it now. All I said was that we do need to do it. We started to argue about that back and forth when our lead walked into the room. She immediately stopped talking like that towards me and acted like this argument never happened. She just acted like her normal self while talking to our lead. She ignored me for the whole day until I left. 
     The third time was when I had just started my shift and Sally had already been working for an hour with Carl. On the door in the room, it lists some tasks that each person has to do during their shifts on that day. The paper on the door was from last week. I threw that one away and put the new one on the door since our lead messaged me to do that as soon as I started my shift. Sally was scheduled to do a specific thing today and I asked Carl if Sally knew that. Carl told me that she didn’t and told me if I could tell Sally that. So I went downstairs and told her that she needed to do the thing she was scheduled to do today (I know I was in the wrong this time since I told her to do it rather than saying hey do you know that you’re scheduled to do this today?) She told me she knew that. She said that she was already going to do it as soon as I got there. She then got in my face once again and said, “I know what I’m doing, you don’t need to tell me because I’ve been working here for X years and I know what to do.” At the time I was surprised that she said that and I responded telling her that I knew that. I was just letting her know. During the day I would notice that Sally would tell everyone what to do. ( My bf and I had just gotten back from our vacation. During our vacation our boss told Sally that she would be in charge of our department until my bf would come back. He had the day off on this day and I didn’t know she was in charge until the next day) Whenever I noticed this, I wasn’t really bothered by it. I just thought it was a bit weird but I didn’t say anything. After my altercation with Sally, I felt like Sally was talking badly about me to my other coworkers in our team. Carl wouldn’t really talk to me like how he normally does after my dispute with Sally. Carl acted that way towards me until he left. When Kim started her shift, she was assigned to do a task with Sally before I was able to see Kim and greet her that day. Every time I tried talking to her about anything, Kim would just ignore me. It wasn’t until when Sally left that Kim acted how she normally does towards me. At the end of the day Sally assigned Kim and I to do a specific task before we both left. She told me to finish doing certain things in the room, and to take certain items downstairs. Without questioning her or telling her not to tell me what to do like she has, I said okay. I wanted to get what she told me done because I figured If I didn’t, then I would get in trouble by my boss for not doing it. Kim finished her assigned tasks and quickly cleaned the room so it would look presentable for the next opener. We both ended up clocking out two minute late. Every time Sally and I would have a confrontation I would always tell my bf after work. He always insisted that I should go and speak to our boss. I stubbornly didn’t want to because I don’t do well in conversations like this, and I didn’t want to make this bigger issue than what it was. 
     The next day was when our lead got back to work. It was like any other day and everyone was working on that day. When it was time for my lunch I went upstairs to put my items in the room. I also wanted to inform our lead that I was going to my lunch. When I was in the room our boss was in there talking to our lead and Sally. Our boss then asked me what Kim and I did yesterday when Sally left. I told him what Kim and I did yesterday and he told me that we should’ve cleaned the room more. He then said that we should’ve taken some other things (he pointed at them) downstairs and that we should’ve refilled our inventory for the next opener today. (The room was pretty clean, and we had enough inventory for that day. The only thing that we did need to do was to get rid of the things he pointed at) Right after he said that Sally chimed in and told our boss that she told me to do all that and that I didn’t do it. I got pretty mad and told him that she never told me that. The only two things she told me to do I did so I wouldn’t have to get in trouble on this day. And then she told him that it wasn’t true that she told me and I 
responded with no you didn’t. Our boss then told us to settle down and he left the room. I left behind him and took my lunch. 
     After I came back from my lunch I looked for my manager and told him that I needed to speak with him about something. We went to the conference room and I told him everything I’ve written on this post. I told him the reason why I didn’t want to say anything was because I didn’t want to start any unnecessary drama. I didn’t want to get Sally in trouble or scold her and make her treat me any worse. He told me I should’ve said something sooner so he could’ve prevented some things that happened and I agreed with him. I mentioned to him that I noticed Sally giving orders the day prior and he told me Sally was in charge because our lead was on vacation. We talked about how she probably acts that way since she thinks that I’m always telling her what to do. Which isn’t really the case. Out of all the arguments we’ve had, I’ve only told her what to do once. I didn’t even mean it in that way. I was just letting her now what she was scheduled to do that way. My boss and I had a 30 minute conversation about everything and told me that he would have a talk with her about it. My both said that he wouldn’t promise me that everything wouldn’t be good 100% since he can only do so much and I agreed. 
     Fast forward a week later after I had the talk with my boss. The busiest time of the year will be starting soon. Pretty soon they’ll be hiring sixteen seasonals to join our team for this holiday. Our lead will be promoted to supervisor for this holiday. And I recently heard that our boss promoted Carl and Sally to leads for this holiday. Once I heard this it made me really upset because I’ve been working in that department the longest besides our lead. I also know more about our tasks overall compared to them. I’m debating on staying in our department or leaving to another one. I feel as if Sally treated me this way while she was a normal coworker, I doubt she’ll treat me any better as my lead. I feel as if our boss awarded her for her behavior. I just don’t know what to do. Should I ask to be demoted to part time in another department and start going back to school? (I have my associates degree but I’ve been planing on going back to school to get my bachelors) Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Should I start going to school now or should I manage through my current position and once the holidays are over, demote to part time and start school? I’m torn and undecided on what to do.",1

On most days after all is said and done, I have about 5 hours of free time. I really want to contribute more time to my personal interests like writing and learning Japanese, but I'm usually just too tired to even think about investing any more of my time productively.

Typically after my day is over I end up doing nothing until I have to go to sleep. 

Its really frustrating, because I'm genuinely interested in writing and learning foreign languages, but I just die after school.

708,Did her reaction to this joke mean I’m Ugly? U.K.," 
work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.",1

195,Need advice on telling my boss I've changed my mind about meetings.,"So I posted about this on another sub basically venting my frustration about decisions the company I work for makes and how hypocritical they are, and also how I am too much of a wimp to say no.

I recently had an end of year review type meeting with my boss and during it he asked if I would like to go along to managers meetings with him in January. After being this past January I can say going to them is the last thing I want to do. Not because I am lazy but because with what has been going on with the company I am completely against there decision to hold these meetings as not only are they pointless, the company will be spending a fortune on them while over the last few years has been cutting costs to save money every chance they get. I could go into more detail about the double standards the people running things have shown but I only have on lifetime.  But in the end I went against my own beliefs so to speak and just agreed as I was too afraid to say no. 

Now I really wanted to tell my boss that I will not go with him to the meetings as they are a waste of my time since they take place during my time off, and that I am against them even holding the meetings in the first place.  

The advice I am looking for is what is the best way to explain this to my boss? 

I know this sounds like such a first world problem but after having a stressful year and being generally feeling flat and worn out recently I really need a stress free winter.",1
425,Boyfriends Obsessive Brother,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year, i’m 19 he’s 24, and for about eleven months my boyfriends brother had tagged along with us for awhile he’s also 19. When I met him we had a lot in common because he was gay and enjoyed much of the same things which led to a friendship to the point where he’d come along while we watch movies cuddled on his couch and stay on the opposite couch all night. This went on every weekend until recently. Over those 11 months he had changed his instagram username to match mine, he shows his friends i’ve never met my private instagram account which makes me feel uneasy, he even talks to my boyfriend or calls me from his phone every time I FaceTime my boyfriend. This week i had enough when he “accidentally” sat on the cake i had got my boyfriend for his birthday, which i had left on the passenger seat to hold on my lap to bring to a party and had to apologize to him for getting upset with him, (I might mention he often insists i sit in the back when my boyfriend drives). I’ve told my boyfriend twice that his brother needs to give us way more space and he took it as a disrespect to his brother. Today I finally snapped when I found out from my boyfriend that he was sharing my private instagram account again, I told my boyfriend that I couldn’t take his brother being so attached to me and i felt uncomfortable, my boyfriend instantly took this as a disrespect to his brother. I felt that he often babied his brother despite him being an adult. My boyfriend had a talk with him again today and his brother blocked me on instagram rather than talking like adults, I told my boyfriend that I wanted to break up because of how uncomfortable I felt because of his brother, my boyfriend told me that i should die and that i was nothing because i wanted to break up since i’ll never get away from his brother. He later apologized but What’s your take on this situation?, Do you think I overreacted in this situation? and Do you think I should leave the relationship?",1
151,Sick from drugs but out of sick hours,"I work in an office type building, my role is not essential in the fact that I'd have to get someone to cover for me.

No PTO but they dont require proof for sick days so it's essentially like PTO.

The way it works is you get 2 hours of sick time every other week. I have a bad habit of saving up 8 hours and then taking a leisure day off. Right now I believe I have 2 sick hours. I have no more vacation time or float holidays to use either.

I took Molly 2 days ago and I'm still very sick from the after effects. I took it sat night and was sick all day sunday. Got down 2 liters of water and some decent food all without throwing up.

I have bought it up with my wife and how it creeps me out ive told her thats its wrong and makes me feel wierd, she says that she doesnt like him it but thinks that im strange for being creeped out about it and doesnt want me to raise the issue with her father.

On a side note, my wife gets shitty at me if i smack her ass like that.. So i feel like that anger should go to her father and not me and likewise feel that if anyone is getting away with it, it should probably be the husband?

501,Do I have anger management issues?,"For the past 6 years my parents started treating me like I am worthless and made sure that I knew it. They keep saying harsh things in hopes that I change, but nothing they said was helpful criticism. And only these past 2 years I have reacted spoke back. It started out with just me trying to tell them that I am not but now has escalated to this.

The argument escalated to shouting, crying, punching a door, then locking myself in my room where I cried to myself and just broke down in tears and couldn't stop crying.

This time it got really bad, I never felt that way before. I lashed out and punched the door multiple times, shouted, then cried, and then a combination of both. I just broke down in my room after and sat on the floor and  cried to myself aggressively. I felt so sad but angry at the same time, I hated them but I just wanted them to leave me alone. 

I don't know if this is because I have anger issues or am I just too sensitive or maybe both?

It's a really embarrassing thing, the crying, the anger and how pathetic. I dislike this part of me, but I don't know what's exactly wrong with me. I don't know how to deal with it.",1

670,Am I wrong here?,"So a week ago one of my closest friends asked me to write his essay for his college class. As he was failing and didn’t know how to write it. So I spent 3 hours writing it. I sent it and he didn’t say “thanks” just  said “got it” not even acknowledge was I did. 

And when I was like “you are welcome btw took a while to do” he just laughed and said “thanks” 

We play this game on PlayStation. And yesterday he made fun of my mom’s accent. She is from Pakistan. And does have an accent. I told him before when he did that to not do that but he did it this time and I let it go. 

Today we were playing with another friend and he died like within minutes of the round. So I said “hey guys let’s quit so Jack can play” the third friend said “alright” so I was leaving and jack said “y’all don’t have to” I pressed quit anyways. 

I was waiting in the lobby of the game and no one came for like 5 mins. So I texted our group that I was waiting and that if they wanna hop off. And my friend Jack goes “just go take a nap calmly. Don’t stress” 

So I texted him privately that I didn’t like what he said and I would like an apology. He said “k” so I texted the group more about how he isn’t being respectful and he kept saying “k” so I told him if he keeps doing this I’m not talking to him. Cause it’s super immature and messed up. 

He said “sorry” and I said “it’s fine just last time you apologized and did it again this time” he said “k” 
Last time we fought I told him my sister got a job as an engineer in a firm and he said “who did she sleep with to get the job?”

819,What’s the most efficient way to get rid of feelings?,"(Throwaway account)
Background: I’m a 24 y.o. female. Had to quit my job cause boss (35-40 y.o. married male) was being weird. Weird as in: touching my face, hands, hair, complimenting me, giving me special treatment, acting jealous. 

Now. I never did anything to encourage it, but I didn’t discourage it either. I was in a horrible mental and emotional state at that time (I’m not excusing myself by saying this) and I liked the way he seemed to care about me. He was the only person who asked me about how I felt, if I was ok, etc. 

Nothing ever happened. And the whole thing ended with him leaning in for a kiss. I left my job. I caught feelings for him. I’m still thinking about him and I feel terrible. 

My new job is close to the last one. I bump into him often. I get tiny little pangs of pain each time I see the guy. I hate it and I feel guilty. How do I stop this? This kind of inappropiate immoral thing never happened to me before. I don’t know how to deal with it.

934,I accidentally broke my moms glass,"She and my dad got a set of matching glasses with their names engraved on them when they were out for their anniversary.

I didn’t see a name anywhere so I was relieved it wasn’t one of their special ones and I sweeper it up and threw it out. 

Today I was unloading the dishwasher and decided to double check to make sure, and I realized I couldn’t find her glass, only my dads and the ones without names. I feel so guilty, especially since this month people have accidentally broken some of her other stuff. I don’t know if I should tell her, because we have a lot of glasses so she may never realize it’s missing.

415,What can I do about my noisy neighbors?,"I recently moved into an apartment building and I share a walls with two other apartments.  One apartment is always quiet (with the exception of normal expected noise), but the other one is incredibly loud.  A couple lives there and every Friday and Saturday they’re hosting a party with loud music and literal screaming.  
I understand that living in an apartment you have to deal with a certain level of noise, and I wouldn’t care if it’s the occasional party, but this is literally every weekend.  I work full time (and sometimes odd hours) and go to school part time and it’s starting to affect my ability to sleep well and get my work done.  I’ve had to leave several times just so i can do my work.

When you walk down the hall of the apartment building there’s no noise coming from any of the apartments until you get to my end of the hall where they live.   I have asked them nicely to keep it down, and they did for that one night but went right back to normal the next night.  

I’m in my 30s and I feel like I’m living in a college frat house with the excessive noise.  I checked the lease and it only says that noise needs to be minimal after 11pm. 

What grounds do I have for formal complaints?  I feel that it is justified due to the frequency and excessiveness of the noise.  I plan on asking the neighbors on the other side of them if they feel the same way, and I have a few recordings of the yelling and loud music.

Is it reasonable to ask my landlord to improve the sound proofing?  What would you do in my situation?",1

858,How to Handle Mental Health Issues and College,"On Friday I (20 years old) had a talk with my grandmother about a summer when I was 4 years old. My father was working on Nantucket while my mom was taking care of me at home in New Hampshire. During this period of time my mother was starting to fall into drug addiction and had a lot of druggie friends around the house and a lot of parties with me just kind of being there. Apparently I was not taken care of well and a lot of shady people were constantly around me. My memory of this time is very fuzzy but I remember lots of people being in and out and one specific memory I have is me in a shower with some guy who likely sexually abused me. Throughout my life I have struggled with self hate, binge eating, isolation and self harm. I managed to make it through school with decent grades and ended up in college with a Pell grant because my father doesn't make much money. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in my junior year and dealing with PTSD. My therapist referred me to a higher level of care with a EMDR specialist to help me fully remember what happened during that fateful summer so I can process it and put it to rest. I can barely sleep at night, have constant nightmares, extreme anxiety during the day and a constant fear of being in danger which has made it extremely hard to manage my schoolwork. I'm worried about failing my classes, losing the Pell grant and wasting a lot of my family's money. I want to focus on taking care of my mental health so I can become a more functional adult but I am not sure how to balance this with my classes. It's my job to get myself together and work towards reaching a better place, I am willing to put in the effort to get better. I'm just not sure what to tell my father or my professors because of being completely overwhelmed and not wanting to become everyone's problem to fix. I want to do my best to make it but I'm not sure if my best will be enough. What steps can I take to come out the other side of this situation with the best possible outcome and least trouble for the people around me?  


tl;dr I've had a lot of trauma come flooding back to me and am seeking the help I need to get better but am unsure how to balance this and my classes without losing my scholarship",1

650,My Dad died almost a month ago and I need to make a change.,"My Dad had been sick for several years.  He had terminal liver cancer and was given 6 months in 2016.  He made it to September 2019 but succumbed to an infection.  He died quite horribly, there was no peace, no comfort...He had so many seizures that I actually hope to God it turned his brain to mush because if he was aware of his final two days and all that pain and suffering I couldn't cope.

Since he has gone I have felt so empty.  While he was sick I volunteered with a lot of stuff to keep my mind off ""what was coming"" and I loved it, it made me, but I haven't gone to anything, not even my actual work, since he passed.  During this time off I have done a lot of thinking and I feel like I need a fresh start.  I want to quit my job and use my savings and the time to sort myself out a bit, get myself in shape physically, mentally and as an employee.  Everyone says it is a really bad idea and is a knee-jerk emotional response to trying to fill a gap but the thought of going back to my job and my volunteering fills me with dread.  I want something different, I just don't know what.  I was starting to feel unhappy in my job in particular before this happened so for me it isn't a feeling that has come completely out the blue but responses from other people have suggested my gut feelings can't really be relied on given how recently I lost Dad.

What should I do?  I feel unbelievably lost.  I just want my Dad back but given that that can't happen I need something to be able to focus on, something really big.  Nothing is holding my attention, concentration is really really difficult and my mood changes almost hourly.  One thing that has been consistent though is ""I need to change something"".  Any advice or suggestions or even just similar experiences shared would be so helpful. 

Thank you.",1
830,my best friend doesn't trust me anymore,"so, this one's kind of a long story and probably boring as fuck but I need some advice. so my best friend, we'll call her Gabby, is very closed off as a person. I've been going through a lot recently, but as I'm phasing out of it I realized that she isn't doing well. she's always had really low self confidence, there are a lot of problems at home (we go to college 2 hours away), and for the 6 weeks we've been in college, she hasn't been able to find a guy she's really into. so she's VERY self conscious right now, and she never wants to open up. the other night I finally pulled it out of her, and the next day was awesome. we got along so well, she was in such a good mood, and we decided to visit a friend of ours that lives on campus to cook dinner and get drunk. fun, right? she once mentioned she had a little crush on him too, we'll call him Taylor. So we go to Taylor's and we're all extremely drunk. like shots on shots of tequila, room is spinning drunk. somehow I ended up in Taylors room and one thing lead to another... and she walked in on him fingering me. of course that was a shitshow, mental breakdown for the rest of the night, and 3 days later she is still acting so weird.  I. get it I sound like such an asshole here, but one more piece that's pretty important. Taylors brother (lets say Scott) happens to be best friends with me and gabby, and that's how we know him. this summer at Scott's going away party, the 3 of us were hanging out, drunk and spilling about how we'd miss each other, etc... and I noticed them getting handsy. I decided to go outside after one of them said we should, and they said they'd be out in a second, so naturally I just waited outside for like 10 minutes. after a while, I realized what was going on, walked in on them having sex, and that was that. I forgave and forgot so fast because I knew it didn't matter in the grand scheme, but now with Gabby being in my position, she is nowhere close to really forgiving or forgetting. how do I get her to trust me again, and how do I get her to open up??? im so lost and so worried about her, please help...",1

I'm a freshman at a college with 30,000 people. I'm lucky to have a great group of friends and a decent social life I guess but I'm terribly unhappy with where I am. I am falling behind so much on school, I haven't worked out in months, I'm addicted to nicotine, and I don't know how to fix any of these problems. These are three of a lot of things I've encountered.

I don't mean to sound lazy, I just don't know how to motivate myself. I tell myself I'm gonna get ahead on school, get mad, make a list, crank out homework in a day. Then the next day, it's back to the same routine. I am unable to commit to anything and I hate myself for it. When I was in high school, I swam competitively 9 times a week, l balanced school well was rarely tired, and fine with myself.

College is fucking hard. I am grateful to be in a situation where my tuition is paid in full by my parents, but I feel like I owe them for what I've done. I just simply don't know how to commit to anything. It's 5:30 AM and I have yet to go to bed because all I can do is look at my phone.

491,I Love My Boyfriend. But Maybe I Love Him Too Much.,"*I just want to warn anyone who will read this that it will go into deep topics that has happened in my past life. Although brief, the post itself is long and I am asking for advice over the situation over my boyfriend and I and not over my personal problems. Also, I don't mention these problems for people to be sorry for me over, but to understand where I'm coming from.*

I would consider the two of us to be really close. When we're around, I solemnly am not around him. We enjoy a lot of the same things (we actually met at an anime convention) and we are planning to go this year once again, especially since we consider it our anniversary.

Here's the problem: We are 80 miles away. We both don't like travelling the long distance because I, after my car accident, had to get a much older car that has 100k+ miles on it and I'm always nervous when I drive it in such a long distance and he has recently got a car, but he and his brother use it; his brother works the night shift while he works the day. We can never find a good time to actually see each other and we never have enough money to do anything.

With all of this, I began to start feeling a lot of depression and when I'm having a hard time or if I end up stopping what I'm doing, I end up missing him greatly and just cry. A real life example was when I was at work, I asked my boyfriend if he could see me on my birthday this Saturday, which he replied that he just couldn't. I was pretty upset about it and we tried to figure out something, but nothing really came to mind for either of us, so we just left it at that, him forgetting to say goodnight to me that night which upset me even more. (ADHD, not entirely his fault, but whatever.) The next day, I was supposed to work until the afternoon and my coworker ended up texting me, saying that she had some pain in her liver so she couldn't come in. It just threw me over the edge and my other coworker came back from the bathroom and asked if I needed a break, which I started sobbing as I nodded to him and ran to the break room, just crying and trying to compose myself. My boss for the night came into the break room and asked me what was wrong, and I found that I was even more upset over how my boyfriend wasn't going to be able to see me as I just told him.

Today at least we were able to see each other and has a nice dinner together and we were cuddling in his car a bit. He noticed that I wanted this more than I wanted anything else and we spent a half an hour together, cuddling, kissing, and singing to some Gundam music.

We were talking in the past before over the fact that I may have a separation anxiety issue, It's entirely possible that it could be the case, especially since I try to talk to him whenever I can, but I think it's deeper. I think it's because I have had a lack of love all my life. My mom died when I was 9 and since then, I have had a dad who abuses alcohol and abused me verbally, occasionally physically, and by simply neglecting me. He had married a woman who had the same issues and had physically and mentally abused me by screaming profanities at me and trying to pull me and the like, things I don't want to get into. Thankfully I have moved away, if not far, at least away from the situation to the point where I don't have to deal with it on a personal level. I've had friends before, but I feel as if all of them had kind of abandoned me and ignore me to this day. Finally, before him, I have felt so much heartbreak in my life that I had the image that I was just an unlovable person in the first place. My boyfriend has been the longest relationship I have have, to this day, is the closest relationship I have with anyone, and most importantly, the only person that I can truly go to with anything I want to say, whether it be a problem or not.

And sex isn't the issue, because I'll be honest; we're both inexperienced. Too not sound entirely NSFW, I can usually take care of that at night on my own with no issue. But I feel like it's his warmth and his arms around me, no matter what time of day it is, that really hurts. I have two weighted blankets. I use one for a normal blanket and use the smaller, yet heavier, one to use it as his arm so it can imitate the feeling of his arm wrapped around me. I also have a body pillow to cuddle as well. But it all just isn't the same. It's not warm. It's not chubby. It just feels like an empty shell of an average person. He even gives me shirts he had worn for a while to me to just have that presence of him, but eventually, the smell goes away and I'm left with nothing.

He has told me that he shouldn't be my only source of happiness, and although I agree with him fully, I just can't seem to get myself to just be like that. I do have hobbies, but I no longer have the money or free time to enjoy a majority of them and I don't really have any friends to talk to about anything, so he's the only person I can really go to to speak my mind. He has told me time and time again that I need to see a therapist to solve this issue, but I told him that I refuse to go to another one again for two reasons: One, every single time I go, I am charged by my insurance $60. Because of that, I have a racking medical bill I have to pay for after I get the rest of my debt taken care of and it's something I don't want to worry about because if I do end up getting really sick, I don't want to get denied to see a doctor. And two, this particular office I did go to cycled through therapists like milk, so I saw one for six months, but when she quit her job there, I saw another one, only to realize that he too was quitting his job after a few months. I went through it until there was no one left and I am not going through that mess again. So therapy is out of the question.

I guess the question of advice I would like answered is what should I do in this situation? Our relationship isn't in any peril, but he does want me to find another source of happiness that isn't him. It's just hard to do when you're always busy with work and don't have anyone else to talk to. I would love some advice about it. I'm tired of being a depressed mess when I want to show him that I'm strong.

But I guess it shows that I'm not. And I need help with that.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My boyfriend wants me to be happier without him since he says that he's my only source of happiness, but I guess I don't really know how to do that. How do I stray my thoughts away from him?",1

I'm trying to figure out how to get a new loan to consolidate my shitty jdbyryder and have enough for a first month and deposit, if my credit was a lil higher or I could find a cosigner I would be able to save a few hundred and keep the kids protected from the nasty stuff that will come if I dont do what she wants as fast as possible. 5k loan at 15% gets me out whole, saving like 250$ a month plus first months costs, 8k or 10k save me less but leave me with a safety net. Any guidance or tips would be great, I'm at a loss and I'm really about to melt down. I've been the care taker for our two year old every day and my heart hurts to think about losing that bond or my son and her not seeing each other daily. I've made 100% of my payments for the car and 100% of my payments in general for the last 3 years but I'm still in the 530-590 score depending on which reports you check.

I feel like I’m annoying my old friend because he has clearly branched out to new friends and here I am, someone from his past just hanging with his new friends thinking I’m coming to the dorm for him when I just want to talk to his friends too. I feel like he’s annoyed that I keep coming but he doesn’t say anything, but he always does question why I come and it’s genuinely cuz I have no one that close for new friends besides his group.

661,"I'm a junior in college, but I still have this anger for my hisghschool towards my English Teacher .","I'm 21, I graduated high school at 17. It's been almost 4 years since I left my high school, I had an English teacher that would always bully me, verbally abusive and very condescending to me. For context I went to a Catholic High school in NY.

Let's call this teacher Mr.F, he was my english teacher and substitute teacher and also the VP for academics in our high school. I first encountered a problem with him when I took my first AP exam and he was our proctor, I made a mistake in removing one of the forms and he yelled at me aggressively like a psycho, he went on a rant for a whole 15 minutes and screamed at me in my face. He embarrassed me in front of my fellow class mates . I couldn't focus on my exam and failed because the experience was so sudden and traumatic.

I went home and cried. I had Mr.F for my english classes when I become a junior and a senior. Mr.F was very bipolar with me sometimes treating me nice and then all of a sudden become very condescending. The last straw was when a few people in class didn't get a book for our last week in class in our senior year and kicked us out. He then singled me out and called me useless. I got tired of him and told off in his face and we went to the counselor. I wanted to report him and he immediately said sorry for what he said to me, and decided to let go at the moment because I want to graduate and knowing him he might try to give me a lower grade for this.

The school still sends me letter to give money to it for donations I just rip them up and throw it in the garbage, but it just makes me so mad that since our family was so poor we paid money for that stupid school. I went to a private school so I wouldn't have to face bullies, but my english teacher ended up being the worst bully in my life and I was powerless because he was the VP and I was just some random teenager.

I just want to scream at him and curse him out if he ever decides to say hi to me in public. He was total piece of shit and sometimes I feel like going to back to the school and curse him out if I see him and just hurt him like he did to me.

so let me breakdown my life

i’m a 21 yo single male who is currently working retail. i’m not in school currently, but have plans to go next year. i suffer from social anxiety so making friends and socializing is a bit hard for me. i can’t afford SA medicine at the moment so there’s not much i can do about that. i sadly don’t have a car or license either. 
i’m aware i need to work on all that, but it’ll be a while before i can because of certain things going on in my life currently. 

i want to say i have a few friends, but only 2 CLOSE friends. the other friends i have are work friends. they’re cool and we talk/text a lot. i know what’s going on in their lives, and we have common interests, but i’m not comfortable hanging out with them outside of work probably because of my anxiety ( i want to get better at this ) 

as far as hobbies go, i have drawing/art, gaming,   watching movies, tv shows, anime, gym, etc i have my guitar and piano that i’m learning but besides those i don’t have much else. i WANT to do more, be more social, have more friends, but i don’t know where to start...  my anxiety makes it so hard to connect with others, and i’m not good at holding conversations... where do i even begin? how do i make more friends and find new hobbies? i’m tired of wasting my weekends locked in my room. i want to experience the world and discover new things but where do i start??",1

860,Unsure about college/med school,"I'm currently in high school, and I'm feeling really lost. 

I find myself thinking about college often. I like to have everything planned out, but the truth is I just don't. Originally I was planning to go to med school and become a doctor to please my Asian parents (both doctors as well.) I know I could do so, I enjoy biology and I know it would help me life a comfortable life as it pays well. However, I'm not sure of what I want anymore. I want to help people, but maybe I'm just lazy- I don't want to go to medical school. I get so stressed even in high school I don't even want to imagine what it'll be like there. I've suffered from depression and low self esteem, and I'm afraid I'll go back down that route- suicide- because I won't be able to handle it. Although maybe I'm just lazy and since I've never had to truly work hard in my life, I don't want to work hard. I don't know what else I could do though. I have to go into a science field, my parents say they won't give me any money for college if I don't go into science (and I can't manage college on my own). I don't have any exceptional talents- I put most of my time into science and medical related activities for college and later med school. But I've realized I really don't want it. But there's nothing else I can do. Being a doctor feels like spending my entire life studying and working, and I don't want to. I want to enjoy my life. I want to help people in other ways. 

I just want to have friends and fall in love and do fun things. Idk but I feel like med school will take that all away. 

I was thinking about majoring in music in college, but there's no jobs for that and I'm not sure I'm talented enough. Plus, if I'm anything else but a doctor I'm not even sure my family would support me or talk to me ever. They're so dead set on me being a successful doctor and I don't want to disappoint them. 

I feel kind of selfish though. Because if I don't become a doctor I can't help people and I only look out for myself. I don't know where this is even going anymore. Because I enjoy helping people- I volunteer a lot and I'd really like to do something to make actual changes in the world- but I just can't be a doctor. I don't know. 

Does anyone have any advice?",1

He was my best friend in all of 8th grade and freshman-senior year of high school. During the end of my freshman year i confessed to him that i really likes him but he gave me mixed signals and basically said he loved our friendship and didn’t want to ruin it. I tried to move on and started casually dating. Then i ended up dating his best friend which is now my current boyfriend. (Let’s call him christian).

I feel like i don’t want to be with him but then i can’t bare with seeing him date someone else or leaving a 2&amp; a half long relationship. We’ve created so many memories together and i just can’t break his heart like this. I’m trying so hard to forget about anthony but i just can’t. What do i do? Should i just keep trying to forget him?

825,"I want to make music, art, games, and books, but can't do any of that, no maktter how hard I try. At least not well.","Hi,

I want to make music, I want to draw and create beautiful art, and I want to make video games, and I want to write books. Unfortunately, I don't know how to any of that, despite my best efforts. I've been trying for years.

# Drawing

When it comes to my art and drawing skills, I'm in my mid-20s and have been drawing since I was eight years old. It hasn't gotten any better. I think it's only gotten worse. I want to bring beautiful, fantastical landscapes like what you find in Shadow of the Colossus, God of War, or Lord of the Rings.  
Just google image search: beautiful landscape art fantasy if you want to know what I mean.

# Music

I've never made music, because I have never been able to afford any musical instruments, and I never got any for my birthday or the holiday season. And even if I could, I've always liked big orchestral movie music like Hanz Zimmer, [Two Steps from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6WI018nImM&amp;list=OLAK5uy_l4CyX5KNbaM4JwuQi4MhMwucbaHC4IXU8&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s), [Audiomachine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGmyVqGX9hY&amp;list=PLtjNioz9_qnx9feeQ-v9BcZuQp2QKe8yh&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s), and [God of War (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9hh91-2iaA). Recently, I've been trying to teach myself to use FL Studio. I haven't gotten anywhere. I think I understand it less.

# Writing

I've been writing stuff since I was maybe fourteen, and I hate what I write. I hate it so much. I know the phrase ""we're our own worst enemy,"" I know that applies to criticizing ourselves, too. I can't get over how god awful my writing is. Then I heard I need to write 80,000 to 100,000 words to publish something, and I probably write 300 words a week. I feel like an ant climbing Mount Everest, and the starting point is Tokyo, Japan, after learning that.

# Video Games

I've tried learning Blender and Unity, but I can't make sense of it. No matter how many tutorials I watch. It's just not something I can do. No matter how much I want to.

Unfortunately, I can't take any full-time courses at university anytime in the next two or three years because I didn't think of it until it was too late for 2019, and I will be too busy from spring 2020 to 2021 or 2022.

I've taken a few short 14 hour courses here and there, mostly for art, but otherwise, I haven't found what I need.

I have so much swimming around in my head that it hurts sometimes. I get headaches. I have ideas, pictures that no one has ever seen, music that no one has ever heard, games that no one has played. Sometimes, I'll sit down and cry from literal pain as my head pulsates, and my ideas mock me for not being good enough.

What can I do about this? Please help.",1

The pain was so bad i asked my mom if i could go to the hospital. He called me and said he was sorry but he doesn’t think we’re meant to be. Wouldn’t even meet in person to discuss it. He said he would always care about me but doesn’t think we’re as close as we used to be. He had been spending more time with other people instead of me. He wouldn’t FaceTime me as much. It was him who pulled away, not me. But I still never thought he would ever do something like this. We were so in love. Practically a married couple even though we were 17. Then a few weeks later, I find out he has a new girlfriend. She is absolutely beautiful. And everything I’m not, and everything he told me he hates about people. How she posts slutty photos, wears pounds of makeup, and wants attention. But she is a nice person and not at all like how she seems online. He takes her to parties and he would never take me. They go sledding with a bunch of his friends (I live in Minnesota lol). What could of happened? Why is he with a girl who is so not  his type? Everyone keeps talking about how the guy has everything now. He is doing amazing in hockey and has a hot girlfriend. He is a tough guy ans wants everyone to believe that. He hides all his emotions. I guess my question is, is his new gf a coping mechanism for our breakup? Or was he genuinely over me that fast after three years together?",1

It is a really good job that pays pretty well with the opportunity to make very good money for my area (Rural Tennessee). 

There are a couple issues I’m struggling with. Firstly, this is not how I saw my life playing out. I may be speaking from a place of far flung dreams or just general starry eyes but I can’t help but be sad about it. Secondly, I feel extremely tired all of the time. I never have time for my friends or my girlfriend. Even on the weekends, I’m just too exhausted to pursue my relationships or hobbies. Thirdly, I feel as if I am being a baby about all of this.

328,I(F21) can not get over the shame I feel of how I coped with abuse using prozac.,"I don't want to get into too many details but I was dealing with delayed PTSD from abuse from my childhood when I was in university and I basically had a complete breakdown. I felt so much shame and guilt after opening up about it I began to drink all the time to feel numb. I flunked out of college, partly due to undiagnosed ADHD, but mostly severe depression and lack of motivation. I lost the little respect I had for myself and slept around and basically made a fool of myself time and time again. I put myself in dangerous situations and was very self destructive. I just didn't care what happened to me. I would also get drunk and talk about my abuse and then hate myself in the morning because someone else knew my ""secret"". some people legit thought I was crazy. I was on some anxiety meds that fucked with my brain chemestry a lot and my decision making. All of the stuff I mentioned above I did when I was on prozac. My (then new) psychiatrist told me that prozac was basically been giving me the same effect that bipolar people get in a manic episode so that was why I was so impulsive and self destructive (I would also get severe depression after drinking)

 I don't take meds anymore and have gone to lots of therapy and have a great support system. I barely drink anymore and I'm doing a lot better mentally. Ive also moved away from the place where all this took place and will most likely never see any of those people again, but for some reason I can't get over the shame and embarrassment of some of the past things I did. I think about it all the time and I hate that some people will only know me for how I used to be.

859,"""Friend"" choked me","Around the beginning of this year, someone who I thought was my friend choked me with no warning for a few seconds. I had tapped him on the back of his neck to let him know I was there when I caught up to him in the hallway at school while heading to our next class together, which was something me and my other friend did to him often. There were many other people around and we were about 20 feet away from our teacher who was standing outside his door talking to another student, so he either didn't see this happen or didn't say anything. He actually cut off my breathing for a few seconds when he choked me. Afterwards I didn't say anything to him and later he acted like nothing happened, though my perception of him had changed in my mind and I didn't consider him a friend anymore. I started distancing myself from him and he started insulting me out of the blue and at random times, and if I ever jokingly teased him he would react as if I had been serious and would angrily defend himself and then hurl more insults at me. Even after months of this and summer break, during which I didn't see him at all, I didn't do anything about it. After school started again, his insults and harassment increased and I couldn't tolerate it anymore so I told him that he needed to stop insulting me when I had never done anything like this to him. Throughout this I didn't mention him choking me and I'm assuming he forgot, but I found out recently that he did the same thing in middle school to a girl where he held up an Icee to her throat and pushed with it for a while which resulted in the girl crying and her friend reporting it to the school administrators. The thing is I can't stop thinking about the aggressive way he treated me and that girl. He has also shouted at me in an aggressive manner to the point where a teacher stepped in and talked to him for the way he reacted. Now he acts friendly to me, but it's hard for me to be around him because of the way he's acted before. He's also kind of popular and somewhat well-respected. A lot of my friends have never seen that side of him, and he has a girlfriend now who I really hope hasn't and won't be treated that way by him. Honestly I'm really angry about the whole situation and the way he can throw nasty insults at people and even physically harm them and get away with it and have plenty of friends, and I'm worried that he'll do it again. Besides reporting the event which happened months ago and which I have no proof of to the school, what can I do? I avoid him as much as possible but we are in a club together and are part of the same friend group. I can't help but feel he needs some sort of reckoning for the way he's been acting or he'll do it again.",1

406,"Should I disclose my ""IQ"" and other psych stuff to a university while applying to a master's program?","This whole idea is a long shot in a lot of other ways too, but I figure the ""IQ"" thing is probably the dumbest part so I put it in the title. I promise you that I'm not trying to waste anyone's time here and I'm really in need of advice. Really, really in need of advice.

I am applying to an interdisciplinary master's program. I read their program guide online and I do not meet their requirements but I might have an ""in"". I don't have a bachelor's but I do have 2 diplomas in one of the disciplines, and 1 of those diplomas is from a school with strong ties to the master's program. My other diploma is a 4.0 dean's honor roll thing with some student government on top. I also have art school credits which actually work in my favor here because this master's program is trying to bridge STEM and arts.

Anyways, my fine arts grades were like C average. My most recent diploma is 2 years of rock solid hard work and finally hitting my potential because I finally learned what my potential was. The school counselor at that school thought I had ADHD so she sent me to get tested. I have an 11-page document that basically says 2 things:
1. I have general anxiety disorder as a result of childhood trauma 
2. I fall within the superior to very-superior range in most of my tests

The general anxiety disorder is a very real part of my life. It held me back my whole life and when I got this report from the shrink it motivated me to get therapy. I know about my trauma and I went straight to a trauma specialist and I paid out of pocket (summer job savings and student loans) to do therapy for the entire time I was at that school. I got a 4.0. First time in my life and I was 31 when I started this. I'm 37 now.

So anyways, why show this report to my university at all? Accommodations. Post secondary schools are pushing HARD for better mental health resources, and depending on the school's attitude towards my anxiety issues they may already have things in place like longer testing times, or alternative testing methods. They could have counselling resources for me. My last school had an academic strategist for me. I got real one-on-one time with him and that helped. PLUS, I'm half-deaf so I got preferred seating and I got to use an FM system during lessons. 

So this masters program will want to know about my anxiety in the very least. I have to disclose that for my own good. That doesn't mean I have to hand over this psych report or staple it to my application or anything unless they need proof of diagnosis to allocate resources to me. 

But what about during the application phase. This psych doc. It talks about almost 3 pages of personal history and some of that might matter. This whole document was literally written for my last school and I to know and I honestly think the 11 tests in it were all picked to demonstrate my academic potential anyways. So maybe I should show it to this master's program, or talk to someone in admissions? 

I don't like that this psych report mentions my childhood trauma. And I don't want my teachers or advisers to know about my ""IQ"" though. I have a lot of fear about living up to the expectations that people sometimes have in their heads. I'm actually really dumb. I'm just smart too. They don't cancel each other out and I do dumb shit sometimes and I sound dumb and I look kinda dumb. And school is hard for me. Like really hard. Crying my eyes out over homework and deadlines hard. I just want to be accepted into this program, I don't want to walk in there like ""What up? I got a big c**k"" or anything. I got a perfect GPA last time I went to school but there were kids there that did circles around me. I just want to get into this program because I really think I could make something special there.

But I just don't know how to bring it all up. My patchwork academic credentials. My need for accommodations. My potential. My deeply terrifying doubts about even attempting a master's degree.

Like I'm basically a low-rent version of Good Will Hunting that nobody bothered to make a movie of because I just don't have what it takes to hit Matt Damon's rock bottom and Minnie Driver would never fuck me. Anyways, I know they're looking for a 4-year degree, but look - all I've got for is two diplomas in one of their STEM fields and 2 years worth of art school credits which is another of their fields. But I wanna do psychology stuff and I've never studied that at school. I've only ready maybe 3 psych books (well, 2 whole books and enough parts of other books that I think it should count). 

I can only really prove on paper that I've been academically worth a shit for two whole years of my life. But it makes sense because those were the very first two years after I found out I was [wicked smaht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1DnltskkWk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=126) and I used this report to figure out the exact shit needed to work on to get those grades.

So anyways, me and my mentor thought I'd fit in at this program and my mentor thinks I can get around the bachelor degree thing maybe but he's not an authority there. He's just another post grad or something. I'm gonna apply. 

I just don't know if I should include this psych report. 
It's 11 pages. It covers:
Reason for Referral (possible learning disabilities)
Background Information (deaf, childhood trauma, school and work history, adult depression)
Behavioral Observations (good social skills, mind wanders)
Tests Administered (WAIS-IV, WMS-IV, WJ-III, RSAT, IVA + Plus, CAARS-S:L, TMT, WCST-64:CV2, PAI, MDI, RISB)
Interpretation of Results (I can't even begin to copy out this stuff. It's a lot about z-scores and statistical stuff. The highest score is the General Ability Index Composite Score at the 99.5th percentile)
Personality Characteristics and Emotional Functioning (trauma, trust issues, risk-taking, guilt, lowered energy level, but I have a positive attitude too I guess?)
Summary (attention and concentration on par with moderate to severe ADHD)
Diagnostic Formulation (""...appear to be very personally well-suited to achieving his academic and career goals"")
Recommendations (a list of 10 accommodation the school could help with).

925,RA Stalking Residents - What Should I Do?,"I’m new to reddit so apologies if there is a more appropriate thread to post this. If there is I will move it there. I created an account and am sharing this because I do not know what to do in this situation and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. I have changed all the names of the people involved and have been vague about details that are not important just for privacy’s sake. 

To make a long story short, I go to college out of state and am on a sports team. I am a leader on the team and two years ago year a girl I’ll call Jane who I vaguely knew from high school visited. After her visit, it reminded me of a guy I also vaguely knew who went to the same school as her and competed in the same sport I’ll call Jon. I contacted him and he decided to look at the school as well. That summer, Jane announced she would come to the school and shortly after Jon did too. 

The first red flag was when Jon told everyone that Jane and him had dated and that she cheated on him. He made sure everyone knew this and told people she was a liar and tried to encourage people not to trust her. He would also get weirdly aggressive when she mentioned anything about guys (high school dances, old boyfriends, people she was interested in etc.) on sport trips or during practice and be extremely rude to her but only when the coaches were not around. When the coaches were present he turned into a giant kiss ass and so they had a real good impression of him while me and others on the team did not. He would also be rude to other people on the team which progressively got worse as time went on. 

Christmas break happened and we all went home. After break Jon received an RA position (if you don’t know what that is it means he is in charge of enforcing rules on a dorm floor and has key access to all of the dorms and the individual rooms of several buildings) from the school. At this point things quickly went from what seemed to be dumb drama to serious issues.

A “last straw” moment occurred and a bunch of people (almost everyone on the team) came to me or the other team leader and complained about various thing Jon had been doing. This was a whole ordeal in itself but the only one relevant to this post was what Jane said. She told us he had been sending her controlling text messages like asking where she was and what she was doing as well as conveniently showing up to wherever she was. I asked about if they had history and if that was maybe why (since that’s what he had told me earlier in the year) and she said they never dated. Apparently he would tell anyone he met that knew her about this and it was messing up her friendships. She told us she was feeling overwhelmed about it and then kind of shutdown about the subject and didn’t want to tell us more. We were concerned and decided to talk to our coaches. We told them and they were confused since he had been real respectful towards them and I honestly think they thought we were just being jealous of him or something since from their perspective he was really nice and helpful. Our coaches are great and would normally condemn behavior like this. They asked me to talk to him so I put together a list of about 8 complaints we had received and met him one day. His response was to literally deny everything. For example one of the things he did was tell Jane not to train with the coaches or team leaders because he could teach her better himself. He texted this to her and I saw the text but when I asked him about it he denied it even happened. Even though I had literal proof.

 After this things just got way worse. He began to lash out and be more aggressive towards just about everyone while at the same time kissing ass even more to the coaches.

One day at a week long sport event in another state Jane privately told me and the other team leader everything else he had been doing. He had been stalking her since high school and I had unknowingly told him where she was going even though she was hoping he wouldn’t find out. He had befriended her parents (similar to what he was doing with our coaches) and so she had a really hard time talking to them about it because she was afraid they wouldn’t believe her. She told us several stories about him stealing her things, showing up at her house and just stalking her in general during high school and then told us about the more recent things he had been doing. More recently he had been using his RA key to get to her room and would “proclaim his love” to her. When she would tell him to leave and that she was not interested, he would beg her and tell her things like “you deserve a guy like me so I will keep trying every week until you agree to be with me” which was a promise he had been keeping. He also somehow seemed to know where she would be and would follow her around. I was totally overwhelmed because I had never experienced something like this and so me and the other team leader decided we had to do something immediately. Luckily, a guy from our school who specialized in stuff like this was actually at the event so we contacted him and set up a meeting the next night. 

The next night we sat and spoke to him for a few hours. He extremely helpful and was concerned. He said to speak with our coaches (which we planned on anyways) and that he would talk to the school and they would look into his behavior and meet with Jon as well as Jane. 

We spoke to our coaches the next day and they said they would contact the school official about it and were kind of shocked that he had been doing these things since he had been so fake.

Unfortunately this was slightly too late but first here is some context for the next events. 

There were 3 buildings we were staying at. Jon’s was the farthest away from Jane’s and mine was in the middle. From Jon’s to Jane’s there was about a 3-5min walk (so nothing substantial). In Jane’s building, there were two floors. Her floor, which was upstairs, and another floor which had Jon’s friend and a bathroom. This is somewhat important later.

The next day after our event ended, there was a party. Almost the whole team attended however Jon left early. He told his friend he didn’t want to see Jane with other guys at the party (she told us this later) so he left with her (his friend) and some others from other schools. She was kind of drunk and he walked to her to her room. However then he somehow ended up in Janes bed naked. Fairly certain he thought he would have a chance with her if she was drunk enough because he hadn’t had a lot to drink to me there is no way what he did could have been done by accident, but more on that later. Luckily, I walked Jane back to her door and she texted me when she discovered him in her bed. She apparently accidentally jumped on him because it was dark and so when she realized it was him she ran out of the room. I came back and confirmed it was him (I think he was pretending to be asleep because there is no way jumping on someone wouldn’t wake them) and decided to put her in a bed with another girl on the team and have her lock the door (in retrospect I could have dealt with this better but I was slightly drunk and kind of shocked).

We reported this to the same school official as well as our coaches and he is no longer on the team. He was told to stay away from Jane but somehow, even though several people (other RAs on the team as well) reported him to the school, nothing happened to his position as an RA even though he was clearly abusing his powers. He told the school that it was all a big misunderstanding and that he thought he was in his friends room because it was closest to the showers (this is where the layout of the building is important because her room was down a hallway and up a set of stairs while his friends was right next to the bathroom so this is clearly a lie) and somehow he got away with it. 

I hoped it would stop there but it did not. When I went back home over the summer I ran into Jane a few times and she said he would call or come into her work and just kind of hang around not buying things. He also, since the school year has started, began to look her up and down and grin at her whenever he runs into her. He only does it when she’s alone or her friends are not paying attention like he’s taunting her since he got away with it. 

He also got a “girlfriend” directly after the thing with Jane and made a weird point to tell everyone about it and tell them about how “in love” he was with her (I think he was trying to discredit people accusing him of stalking). But then they broke up because she was transferring. This seemed fishy to me but I couldn’t say why. 

This is the third semester he has been here and I recently found out the real reason his “girlfriend” transferred. I by chance ran into some of her friends and according to them they never dated and he would show up to her room (one he had key access to since he’s still an RA) and force her to hang out with him. Sound familiar? Apparently one night he went to her room and she ended up locking herself in the bathroom (the dorm has their own bathrooms in the rooms and he has no access to them but does to the main doors) and slept there because he wouldn’t leave and kept going on about how she deserved a good guy like him. This was apparently a big part of why she transferred from the school. This was also after the stuff with Jane so he had been specifically told by the school that that was not ok but did it anyways. To make things worse, I have heard recently from his friends that he is “dating” a girl from his dorm which makes me worried that the whole cycle is repeating itself again, especially since I have only heard from his friends and therefor his perspective. 

This was reported to the school again and again he was let off the hook so I am not sure what else I can do about it. A lot of people reported things and the school (more specifically the department that controls dorm life) hasn’t done anything other than warn him to my knowledge. I am mainly concerned for two reasons. First, he has key access to all dorm buildings and access to. Second, he is trusted with access to school databases that give information about where students live and what their schedule is. In my eyes this is like a dream come true for a predator like him and things are only going to get worse. Not to mention he is supposed to be a role model and is getting payed to do what he is doing. 

Does anyone have any idea what I can do? I want to help but don’t know what my next option is.

Thanks sorry this was long but I wanted to get the whole story out. It may just sound like drama but I’m actually super concerned about the people he is supposed to be taking care of. He’s well respected enough that Im worried people won’t report him or if they do it will be overlooked.",1

My dad just tells him not to do it again and then tells him he can use the computer. I’m like wtf, this is so unfair.

(I probably feel akward faster then most people) For instance a few weeks ago i was at a party one of my friends had. He was the only one i knew and the other people there were all guys and knew eachother. The guys didn't really try to talk to me and I felt pretty akward and didn't really know what to do.
Another time i was invited to a small party with a girlfriend of mine and it were all girls and again all friends of eachother. I talked a bit but was again not that included because they were all talking to eachother. Also i felt and probably looked pretty akward and I hate the feeling of being akward. 

I know i maybe should be the one trying to talk to the other people in these situations, but I find this hard to do because i feel like im bothering them and i dont feel very included.


So do you guys have any tips to help me in these situations? Do you guys know what to do?
Also: i really hate feeling akward fast. So do you guys have any tips for not feeling and looking very akward in social situations where i dont feel included.

TL;DR: I don't know what to do when im in social situations where i don't know anyone, but the people there are all friends and know eachother. I also feel very akward in these kind of situations. So do you guys have any tips?

Thanks!!",1

74,"I think my drink was spiked, what should/can I do?","So this might be a little long but I've had at least 2 panic attacks since this happened and I don't know what to do. I need some advice.

My partner and I went to a friend's wedding reception and we were having fun with friends. I'd had about 3 drinks at this point, leaving my fourth on a table where my partner was sat as I went to the bathroom. Maybe not the best move, but being with friends I thought it was fine.

I remember coming back and finishing the drink. It didn't have my straw in it but I didn't think much of it. After that, I remember pretty much nothing. My vision was absolutely messed up, and waking down the hallway felt like climbing a goddamn mountain. Apparently I did karaoke and wandered off for an hour outside in the smoking area with two girls I'd never met before. 

I don't remember going back to my friends house and the next thing I do remember is waking up on a chair covered with my own jacket. I passed out again and woke up in a  taxi to someone else's house and passed out on the couch there. I woke up and remember being confused so walked out of the house, intending to walk home.

My partner called me and found me as I walked back down to meet him, but then stormed off as I said I wanted to go home now, he wanted for go back to the house. I walked three miles home then projectile vomited for 6 hours afterwards. 

I'm terrified because the only memories I have feel like dreams. Every other night no matter how many drinks i've had or if I'm about to pass out I can always get myself home and remember what happened the night before even if it's a little patchy. I feel like I couldn't really see, and the whole is just weighing on my mind. I don't know what to do but it feels like I was completely out of control. It's weighing on my mind so much.

Any advice or ways to get over this/process it? And yes, believe me, I've had the thought what if I did just drink too much and can't remember? I cannot stress this enough, even when I've gone way over my limits I still remember what happened. This feels wrong.",1

467,I don’t know whether or not I should take the job what do y’all think?,So my life has been a little depressing. Earlier this year I decided to take a semester off of college (this semester right now) because I was confused. 2 months before I quit my job because i couldn’t balance full time and school. Since I don’t have school I have been applying for jobs left and right and finically I find a place that I would like to work at. I apply and they called me yesterday asking if I could go in for an interview 2 hours later. I said yes without hesitation ran to get presentable and made it 15 minutes early. I killed the interview made the guy laugh and I could tell it went really well. The position was part time and he told me he had interview a really qualified candidate before me but that he likes me. He asks if I would be interested in another position so I said yes and he told me they would be in touch. Today I got a call saying that they want me to take a full time position that paid 16/hr and had full benefits. They left a voicemail and there were complications so they are gonna call me back tomorrow to clear things up but one of my friends told me that if I take the job next semester when school starts I would be “back in the shit” and he knows I won’t quit on a job only 3 months in.

Got a job in an office setting as an accounting clerk in August. I accepted the job because I've strive to have a career in finance and was hoping this would be a good stepping stone for me as I take a gap year for school. Don't get me wrong, the work wasn't hard at all, but somehow I manage to suck at it. Last week I ended up quit for multiple reasons, one being I just couldn't adapt to the office environment (maybe it was the people, idk), and another being I hated the job the job in general (just really repetitive). Adding to it, it made me realize how much my mental health as negatively impact me, causing me to overlook the necessary attention to detail the job required. 

As far as my mental health, I am currently looking for help (still having trouble though). For the rest of it, I don't know what to do. For now I think the best thing to do is to look for a job that pays the bills. Yet again, should I still look for other office jobs so that when I apply for internships I have something to show? For my resume, should I leave this two month period of working as an accounting clerk on or should I just abandon it? What do I tell employers either way? 

The only good thing to come out of this is that I now know that I hate accounting lol.",1
409,Friend and cocaine,"Ok so I just made one about my drunken night, but two of my friends came fo me and discloses something to me.

So I have a group of friends that I have been close with for a few years now, I would proudly say these are some of my best friends. Two of these guys are really close. Let’s call them Doug and Fred Like as a group we are all best friends, but these two do everything together and are basically brothers. 

So Fred of them goes to college in Maine, and Doug is home in the DC area. The rest of us (6 total so 4 others) all go to college or, live in the DC area. 

Doug tells us yesterday that Fred has gotten into snorting coke. Fred is our boy but Fred is always the one to try and experience substances. He got Doug hooked on vape, then weed, and now is trying to get him to snort coke. 

I don’t like weed, and my only thing I do is drink, and I try not to because I have a issue of drinking to much at parties. The rest of our friends either smoke weed, occasionally, or drink a little. 

I don’t want my friend Doug go get hooked on this, because he has a very addictive personality. Since Fred got him hooked on vape, he never put it down, and since he got him hooked on weed, he gets high every second he can. 

I have my own life to worry about, and can’t make Doug do something and I can’t make Fred not do something. Idk",1

813,How do I start to move on and rebuild?,"Throw away account. Apologies for the long rant and if none of it flows well. My head is just all over the place.

So recently I gave up my whole life and moved to the other side of the world for love. I met a guy last year (August) while he was in my country for a mates wedding, we had a LDR/ online thing going for about 6 months. Talking every day. Then I went on holiday to see him (in February). We were unsure how to proceed. We both admitted we loved each other but the only way it would go any further was if I moved out to be with him because he has 3 kids and all young.

Age difference of 11 years. I'm 27, he's 38. Didn't bothered me. He said it didn't bother him. Weird thing that I didn't even notice it most of the time. Except when he's moan about feeling old and I'd take the piss a little in a joke playing around way. 

When I returned we continued to talk about whether or not to jump and take the risk. I was sure, cause it just felt right. And that's not me! I'm normally overly cautious. But for once I felt calm and settled with the idea. After talking everything through he phoned me in the middle of the night, 2 weeks later, and asked me to move out to be with him. I couldn't have been happier. 

I gave up my career, my house, everything. But it felt so right! We worked out it would take another 6 months for me to move out, given time for me to sort out stuff like the house and job.
We would spend 4 hours a day talking on the phone about everything. He became my best mate not just my prospective partner. We have (had) so much in common. Interests, values, what we want from life. I'm not over maternal, not in the sense that I want my own kids. Sure we talked about it, but if we couldn't have or didn't want, then I was fine with helping him raise his. He asked me to do the love language quiz, found I'm more about spending quality time with someone, and physical touch. Which I kinda knew anyway. Just didn't know that a ""live language"" was a thing. His was words of affirmation. So I wrote out 50 reasons why I loved him for his birthday. Sent him 5 every week until he came to visit me. He knows everything about me. I thought I knew everything about him. He really is my ideal partner. I'd never felt like this about anyone before. 

He came over in May/June to meet my family, and we travelled a little around the country just chilling. We got stuck for 4 hours in traffic on the motorway - complete standstill because of an accident. Never have I had so much fun in traffic! Just singing and messing around. Holiday was spent camping and hiking. Camping I never had a chance to do before but he loved it and when I tried it, found I loved camping too!

I arrived in his country exactly a year from when we first met. I became a part time step mum. Taking on 3 kids. I found a job really quickly. I loved the life I was starting to build. I loved being with him, and his kids. I loved the little things like having dinner ready when he finished work. Crashing out on the sofa when we'd both been working and the kids were in bed. Food shopping, house chores etc. It was just easy and felt happy.

Sure it wasn't perfect. I say ideal partner, but everyone has their baggage and flaws. But to me they didn't matter, or were things that we could both work on. I'm on about my baggage as well as his (I may be young but I have my fair share already). We had a few conversations before I moved out about our own insecurities. He was married for about 15 years previously, together with her for 18 years. I was in a 5 year relationship before I met him. I have my own issues from my childhood. He knows everything about me. We never argued about anything. But we did have a few kinks that we talked through, and were able to see each others view points on the issues, resolve them and move passed. We knew it wasn't going to be easy. He was going to have to adapt from being a single parent to having someone around. I had to adapt to a new country/lifestyle/culture. But found I loved it and adapted really quickly.

Anyway, 20 days from when I arrived, I picked him up from work. We had a night to ourselves as the kids were at their Grandads. I was thinking nice chilled night, dinner and ""dessert"".
He then tells me it's over. It's not going to work out. And he needed to end it now before the kids and me got too close and when it ""would inevitably end"" his kids would get hurt.

Needless to say, I didn't see it coming! He gave me really weird ""reasons"". For example, how I watch cartoons to chill and wind down at night, where as he has a beer (btw I can't drink, I'm alcohol intolerant). 
I don't like the sport he loves - I was actually learning the rules of it to surprise him next time we watched a game together. 
He was only going to hurt me in the future so better to end it then than ""death by 1000 cuts"". 
His ex once told him he showed more affection to his kids than he did her and she resented it - I said she's fucked up for that, and I understand a father's love is displayed differently to a partners so never compared it!

These are just a few reasons. Eventually he said he was rethinking everything 3 WEEKS BEFORE I arrived. That he realised ""it wasn't going to work"" and his love for me ""changed to close but not a partner"". 

I found another place to stay and managed to work and stay for another 5 weeks, trying to convince him we could try dating, only when he didn't have the kids if he was worried about them getting hurt. I gave him space, wrote him a letter explaining how I felt about the reasons and that it didn't explain why he felt an adult relationship would end. He rejected my offers. Saying he just ""knew it wouldn't work and we'd be unhappy"".

Eventually I couldn't cope. I wasn't eating or sleeping, and mentally was not in a good place. My parents booked me a flight home. Now I'm living with my parents, still can't eat or a sleep properly. Self-care has kinda gone way out the window. Feeling pathetic and worthless. Like I wasn't worth trying for. That my life is pointless, and I can't make anyone happy, even giving up my life for him. I love him and miss him so much! I'm still not mentally right. I've been back a week. I can't go back to the job I had - so I'm now unemployed, which I have never been since I started working while at school. And I just want him. I miss him. I miss the kids. It's so painful to think of them. I can't look at pictures of them. 

I guess I'm wondering - where do I go from here? I don't know what I want anymore. What job, where I want to live? I have to rebuild my entire life!",1

535,Feeling somewhat uncomfortable being overpaid for dogsitting,"This past weekend, I offered to take care of a family friend’s two dogs while they go out of the state. In the past, they haven’t had much luck with past dog sitters since the dogs seem to have an anxiety issue and make a mess if left alone overnight. So, they asked me to sleep over at the house for one night. They had briefly mentioned that they would pay me, but I told them that they didn’t have to do that (especially since I would be taking care of the dogs for less than 48 hours). They insisted on paying me, but they never told me how much they were paying me. The dogs were great and I had absolutely no issues with them. 

Today, they came by my place to pick up their keys and drop off the money (I wasn’t at home at the time). When I checked, I saw they had paid me $100. I feel like this is way more than they should’ve paid me ($100 makes sense for an entire week of work, but not less than 2 days) but I don’t want to seem rude. Should I bring this up with them despite the fact that they’ve already insisted on paying me? If so, how should I go about telling them this without offending them or seeming too demanding or uptight?

Edit: While there were no issues with the dog, an issue did come up with a car being suspiciously parked and running in view of the house. It was a bit of a stressful situation, but the car disappeared and nothing became of it.",1
964,How to get my upstairs neighbour to stop their toddler from destroying my sanity,"Hey I’m on mobile, sorry!

We have lived in this condo for about 5 years, never heard anything from the apartment above us, maybe the occasional footsteps but nothing unexpected. Never hear anything from next door either, so it’s a safe assumption the building has pretty good sound proofing. 

A family moved in a couple months ago and they have a toddler. I am not a parent but I get that toddlers are going to run around. The noise, oh my gosh. It’s woken me and and my roommate up on several occasions. And (s)he will run around for several minutes at a time. Can’t hear the adults walking around at all, but this kid is enough for 3 families all doing jumping jacks at the same time. 

I work shift work. Got home from work 4 hours ago and now I’m wide awake. This happens multiple times a week. My roommate is also the owner of our apartment and has spoken to them but nothing has come from it. 

Like I said, fully understand toddlers are gonna run around, but also they need to understand that they have people living beneath them and it’s affecting their sleep and was wondering how to best phrase everything I need to say? Got a feeling that my sleep deprived self is not going to be the most diplomatic. Thank you!",1
778,Should i quit my new part time job?,"I was supposedly hired as a early stocker for a grocery store (scheduled for 6am-2pm). Today was my first day and got little to no training. The manager who hired me was really nice but gave only a bit of instructions ( he was busy helping cashier most of the time). He taught me how to use the cardboard baler and organize produce. Another stocker who was suppose to show me around and tell me how things worked was no help at (he was sorta old could barely speak english) and he was really rude to me, ignoring questions i had and getting mad when I was helping stock new products in the back saying things ""no not like that man!"". Another female employee passed by around 1 told him   ""Be nice to him"" to which he scoffed at. Now my manager is asking me to come in at 10 am next week (wtf). I felt like I was just in the way the whole time winging it, and felt more like floor associate with so many customers asking me where thing were and if we had items in stock ( which i had no clue and helped find anyways).

252,What would you do? My complicated love/friendship life...,"What would you do? I have been close with someone for a while now. Let’s say we have known each other casually for about 6 years but have become inseparable this last year. I know him through a family member and we have some mutual friends. I’m a female and he took me out for Valentine’s Day (as friends) everyone says how adorable we are together and ask if we are dating. When we are in public people ask if We are together and he just says yes. Finally around April someone confronted him when drunk and said stop playing with her the way you two act around each other everyone can feel the tension. So that led to a drunk talk with him basically ending with us saying we are just friends nothing more. He knows I had feelings for him in the beginning but during that convo I just said I used to have a  crush on u when we first met but that was a long time ago basically. We sleep together. No sex. Snuggle. Share drinks food etc. but never any making out or touching besides intense snuggles when drunk lmao. We do everything together he is one of my best friends and I didn’t even know it was happening until it was to late. I fell in love with him. Around the same time (April) he had a drunk talk with a mutual friend and said that he wasn’t sure why he didn’t have feelings for me. Basically with his ex’s he knew there was something there immediately but with me he didn’t feel that. (Side note all his relationships were super short so like obviously that feeling wasn’t a great indication lmao) I’m so frustrated because things have intensified so much since April. We are closer now then ever. I am super close with his family and on Friday night his sister opened up to me and said his mom basically was pulling for us to end up together but then she got to know me and thinks I am way to good for him. Who says that? Everyone that we both know says I’m to good for him. And he’s stupid and isn’t gonna realize what he had until it’s gone. I can’t hold out hope for that and If that was so true and I was so incredible then why aren’t we together? It’s frustrating. So now... he got a job in a different state a few hours away. He leaves in a few months and we go on vacation together with his 2 siblings before he leaves. I was the first person he told and he sat there waiting for me to react but I had nothing to say. So what do I do? Do I tell him how I feel before he leaves? Tell him that I don’t think he ever gave us a fair shot. Tell him that I want something more? Or do I just let him go and not say anything. I always thought I knew what love was but I didn’t until I met him. Either way I will see him again as our families are and will be intertwined (complicated) and his family still lives here. He says he’s gonna visit all the time and that I’m gonna visit him. If I did say something it wouldn’t be me trying to get him to stay it would just basically be me getting my feelings out willing to give it a shot regardless of distance. What do I do? I don’t want to seem desperate and ruin our friendship but it’s just such a hard situation. I know he feels something but I just dont know what it is? Why are men so complicated.

TLDR: in love with a man whose moving. Is my best friend and we had a convo months ago and I said I liked him in the past it was history and we decided we should just be friends. Now I’m debating if I tell him how I feel before he goes. I want to give it a shot distance or not but is that pathetic of me?",1

We aren’t exactly the most financially stable household, my mother is disabled (for reasons other than my father) and my younger sister is too young to work. I make slightly above minimum wage at my job but obviously there isn’t much wiggle room for an 18 year old about to go to college. Now that my financial situation is explained, if these feelings aren’t normal, then what can I do? I can’t afford to go to the doctor, let alone therapy or other treatments. 

I’m absolutely terrified that these emotions, stress and anxieties aren’t even legitimate. What if it’s all in my head, and I don’t have a mental disorder? What if i’m just an attention whore, like so many ignorant people that feign mental illness? That’s probably my biggest fear about whatever mental disorder people claim I shown signs of. 

Not only that, i’m scared that I can’t pursue the career I want because it’s so difficult. Of course I had to fall in love with cinematography, the one field literally nobody can break into. How am I gonna afford college for that?

Obviously there’s fafsa and certain sites that offer free textbooks but i’m terrified that even with those, I won’t have enough. Not to mention my own day-to-day anxiety attacks and meltdowns.

188,"Lost my best friend and not sure how to cope, need advice","First off, on mobile so sorry for bad formatting. Also, leaving out some details. 

I lost my best friend a few days ago. He didn't die, but we're no longer friends so he might as well be dead. We had a huge fight (over nothing) and in the process he accused me of using a confidence against him to deliberately hurt his feelings. I was ADAMANT that this was not the case, just a poor choice of words. I have a history of being a pathological liar, amongst a few other character flaws which aren't relevant. I was adamant in insisting this because A) I've been working hard to actually take responsibility for the things I do, and B) doing so would besmirch one of only two character traits I can take pride in: Loyalty. To explain what I mean by loyalty, I personally believe that anything a friend shares with me should be taken to the grave. To suggest that I would use a confidence against said friend hurt, a lot. I may be a lot of things, a liar included, but blatantly cruel to someone I considered a friend is not one.

Essentially, my friend wanted me to apologize. I refused, since I equated apologizing for something I didn't do with being the same as admitting that I'm a piece of shit who would use my friend's insecurty against him. Lots of name calling from my friend. We have a history of arguments going too far, but when this all started (Friday) I was trying to keep in mind that I would rather not let things devolve to that point since I had bought tickets to a sporting event for his birthday for Saturday. I was really excited, and more than anything I wanted to go, which is why I repeatedly tried to talk to my friend in hopes of finding a compromise. I even apologized for the poor choice of words, even if I didn't apologize for saying them - or the intention he misconstrued. Nothing worked. He insisted that I did use his insecurty against him, and that this wasn't the first time. Honestly (seriously) that was news to me. Again, my sense of loyalty is probably the only pure thing about me, so I just don't see myself ever doing what he said. I thought back on every fight we had since he confided in me and came up with nothing remotely close (outside this incident).

Maybe, had it been about anything else I might have apologized (half-heartedly probably) just to have this be over. But not this. I want to be a better person so it seems counterintuitive to admit to being a shit friend, especially when I know I didn't do what I'd been accused of. Just thinking about it, if I should just yeild my principle for the sake of not losing someone dear to be, I became so numb. I have a history of depression so that's definitely not a good thing. Then, the more I thought about it, the less numb I felt until all I now feel is anger. 

To me the whole thing seems to have started with my friend getting irrationally upset - I answered a question with a question. It escalated more, even after apologizing for my dumb question, despite the fact that I was really doing everything I could think of (outside sacrificing my principles) to resolve the argument. Then he accused me of something I know I did not do at the time, and could honestly not think of ever having done in the past. It culminated in my friend demanding that I either apologize and admit to being a low person, or maintain my self-respect bit lose my friend. I chose my self-respect. Now I'm out a best friend, and between seething rage and bone-chilling numbness I'm having a hard time coping. I'm really hurt. What can I do?",1

236,I have not spoken to my brother for years,"Me (F21) and my brother (M16) have not spoken to each other for years and I'm pretty sure it's my fault.
Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.

I was the first child in my family, my parents love me unconditionally and I'm grateful for that. When I was 5 yo, my mom told me Im gonna have a brother.
Fyi I live in an Asian country and it is still slightly that everyone prefers a son than a daughter. 
It was not that hard in my family but I still can feel it somehow. At that time everyone kept teasing me that my mom and dad won't stop loving me bc of his presence. It sounds so stupid now but back to that time I was completely convinced.

I guess I was jealous with my brother but I did not think about it that much. I dont remember exactly about my relationship with my brother after that but things was just fine. We are not too close but definitely not enemies. A couple years lately, my brother get into his teenage years and that is when things get conflict. I can not stand his personality mostly because I think he is the ""mommy boy"".

My family is kinda traditional and my dad is quite strict to me (we're asians lol) but then puberty hit and I start figuring myself, trying to be independent and then slowly stop listening to my parents. On the other hand, my mom was spoiling him, she's gonna help him with everything and does not give him a chance to grow up (I guess she does not want things happen to him like me)
She still packs his bag for school, getting his clothes ready, tie his shoes, help him with his jacket, etc... until now and it really annoys me.
I am not so sure if my mom's style raisimg him has affected on the relationship ưith my brother . I believe I have grown distantly from him which make us barely talk. 

We are living the same roof, seeing eachother's faces everyday but yet I still find it is unbearable and hard talking to him. Ofc sometimes we still talk for things like what's to get for dinner or if I need him to lock the door while Im leaving, it's just not the normal family talk. I guess he's supposed to feel the same way due to my distance to him. I mean I know I have already built a wall and it has led to him thinking that way.

And it scares me cause there is a part of me knowing him as my brother but I can not feel that family sibling connection. I do not hate him but sometimes I just have no feelings toward him.

927,I only have one person to talk to,"So a bit of background about me, I have dysautonomia and currently am being tested for EDS, LPI, as well as minor seizure activity. I've been having health issues for the last four years, I wasn't able to attend school for more than a semester and a half out of three years of high school (I had to graduate early because I couldn't handle continuing to do school). Because of this I had a very limited number of people that I could call ""friends"" and while I was fine with that because I only need a few good ones, I can no longer call them friends. Shortly after I stopped attending school physically due to my health they all stopped talking to me. Since then I had only one friend that would hang out with me and invite me to go out with her and her friends, but suddenly a few months ago something changed. Thankfully around that time I met my boyfriend online (I'm technically not allowed to talk to people online so my parents dont know about him). Recently my boyfriend has been my only main support through all of my health problems because while my parents take me to the appointments and stuff, they dont really help with stress (we get into fights almost daily, one of which being about me needing to meet people by going to support groups, etc.). While having my boyfriend be supportive and loving is great, I always feel like I'm a burden on him because I always rant about my problems to him and I end up feeling bad because I'm constantly complaining to him. Since he's the only person besides my family that even talks to me (besides doctors) he's the only person I can rant to about my parents when they do something that makes me feel absolutely awful or upset. I would go to counseling and do the ranting there if I could but due to insurance issues the only counselors I can see aren't exactly sound of mind (one tried to give my dad and I a book that her cat wrote). I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like if I keep complaining to my boyfriend all the time that I'll end up pushing him away and that he'll start to lose feelings for me, but at the same time there's no one else I can talk to and no way for me to really meet people.

To put it short: I have an illness that prevents me from going to school. I had friends but they all stopped talking to me when I couldn't go to school anymore. The only friend I had after that suddenly stopped talking to me a few months ago and around that time I met my boyfriend. Currently he is the only one I can talk to about my issues with my parents because due to insurance the only counselors I'm able to see aren't sound of mind, and I dont know what to do anymore because I dont want to keep pushing all my issues onto my boyfriend, but at the same time need an outlet to talk to someone when my parents and I fight (practically every day).",1

I’m a 15 Yr Old Male in High School so this is the type of age it’s at. Still any good advice can really work here and is much appreciated.

So basically for a while now I’ve had a crush on this girl, very passionate about it and I wanna just treat her right. I’d say that from what I’ve heard from people I’m in her league and that I definitely have a chance cause we both have very similar interests. So I basically was very happy to hear that honestly, so I made my plan to tell her how I feel at the homecoming dance. Which it took time, since I was very antisocial about it, and right when I thought I had my confidence up, I couldn’t do it, I felt like such a failure for not being able to say something, but luckily I told her, but it was on instagram. 

I pulled a online confession, which I know already is a horrible way to go about anything really. 

Still I woke up and she responded and it wasn’t obviously what I was hoping to hear. She said how she was flattered and she wasn’t gonna make fun of me for it and she isn’t interested because she currently is into someone else. 

Of course though I’m not an asshole or a poor sport about it I just said hope things work out well for her and then stopped messaging for a little. Then hours later I decided, I don’t want this to be the end of the convo though, so I asked her if she wanted to be friends. No response, she left me on delivered and ignored my message. I just thought maybe she didn’t see it so around midnight (which was 11 hours later from when I sent it) I sent a more meaningful paragraph telling her how I didn’t want to ruin anything and just be friends and all. It’s been around 16 hours from that and she has been active on insta recently, which is very hurtful to my heart because I just want to treat her right and show her some love. 

The thing is though, how do I get her to notice me, I literally triple texted and I know that is low, should I try talking to her at school tomorrow? 

Another question do you guys think there is any way to win her over? 

I need any advice here, I really don’t want to give up on her. I wanna be the one for her and show her I’m an amazing person. Yet it feels like she doesn’t even want to recognize my existence. 😕",1

498,My Ex has claimed she still loves me.,"We broke up about 2 months ago now, was a serious relationship for about 2 years, looking to move in and start a family after she finished her finally year at university.

Unfortunately she ended it due to her having depression issues and not wanting me to have to deal with the fallout, I tried to argue my case but just respected her decision as I didn’t want to make anything harder for her.

She completely cut off any contact with me after that as she feels like she’ll be a burden to me moving on and finding a new relationship in the future. A couple of days ago she messaged me saying ‘she still loves me and i’m the only one she wants to be with, she just needs to sort herself out’.

Obviously I never wanted to break up with her, and I don’t think i’ll be moving on for a long time. I’m just unsure if I should wait, keep trying to ensure her she’s not a burden on my life and try and sort it all out so we can one day be together again.

I'm a teenager, and I need some help. I wanted to be social all my life, but I'd just mess up over and over again and embarrass myself whenever I spoke to. I had no idea what was the problem, but my sister would point it out to me and I'd beat myself up over it. So, I stopped talking to others unless I really needed to, so I could stop hurting and feeling guilty.

I have a close acquaintance, and I enjoy her company. Recently, she told me that she thinks that I am autistic, and that I should check it out. So, I researched quite a bit on the subject and had to conclude that I share many autistic traits. But, my parents are pretty old-fashioned, and they think that any  kid who could function properly and called themselves autistic was faking. So, I'm scared that they will think that I am faking. I don't want the mockery I will face at school. But I want to get better.

I've been going through a rough patch for what seems to be all my life. My parents brushed off any sensory or social issues I had to take me to their big parties with their friends, throughout my childhood. I smiled, and looked at them, and talked. I've been faking all my life, and I tired. I'm so tired of the mask, but I know that if I take it off, I will be ridiculed. But it's getting harder to do now.

20 minutes ago one of my professors saw me in uni and said that she needs an urgent substitute teacher for one month for 9th and 10th grade high school English classes. 

Help! I have halfway agreed (I told her I'll check it out with the other teacher and see if ill be able to combine it with my own classes) but I don't know the first thing about teaching and have never ever ever done it. She calmed me down by saying that they'll give me schoolbools to follow but they're TEENAGERS! How do I deal with them? How do I even teach them anything.

I also have crippling anxiety and a werid depression and am seeing a psychologist about it (who I can't talk to before making my final choice). My stomach is already in pain because of that anxiety and I really don't know how to handle a class full of teenagers and how to deal and talk and anything with them. I'm not the most social person and also don't look physically too much older than them (people can give me 18/20 years but the teen fashion is a lot of make up and long nails and that's why they probably look wayy older than me so that would be awkward). 

Do I decline it or do I soldier on somehow for a month? I don't need the money that much but perhaps the experience would be nice.. I am so anxious and my body starts to hurt from the stress of the unknown. Please help me. Thank you so much.

980,I cant tell if my crush likes me or is playing,"Hello everyone,
I have no experience in dating and suck at flirting but this year at college i met a guy and he instantly became my crush. He is really attractive and i had the luck to be in a group with him. So, he is extroverted,  and i am really shy and become very awkward around him. He talked to me several times, one day we were at a friends house for the homework and my friends went to but food so there were like 4 people left in the house, he loves to sing and he started to sing Perfect- Ed sheeran, and asked me if i wanted to dance. I said yes. We had a class of drawing together and he would always help me or went to my desk to talk to me. He always smiles at me. And when we are sitting next to each other, he always touches my arm, the other time he even recorded a video and touched my head. He asked me once if i have already eaten, i said no and he told me why i didnt tell him so he could have bring me food. Last semester, we didnt share classes together, but in this semestee we have one class in common, is important to mention that i never start conversation because im really nervous, he is the one to always talk to me. So in this class, he sat next to me and touched my arm saying, i really missed you, where have you been? And started joking around and well i only laughed with him because i dont what to say. Next day, he took his phone and started recording me saying “here, she is the love of my life. She is really shy but i love her like that” . Next day, he sat next to me and said he wanted to grab my hand and i let him. He said i was pretty and all that. And tha professor was talking about infinites so he said his love for me was infinite. You know this is what makes me think he is playing around, maybe he knows i like him and thats why he messes with me. I cant really tell. Help me please.",1

918,I’m torn between jobs,"About two years ago I began applying at a newly built manufacturing facility. We’ll refer to this has company “A”.  The company pays great, and it made waves in the community. At the time I was at a job that I absolutely hated, and left it for a another job that I told myself was the “placeholder” job before I could get into said brand new facility. We’ll call this company “B” My problem is, the “placeholder” company I now work for has been extremely good to me. I have worked my way up into a higher pay scale, and now have a strong bond with my co-workers. I feel valued, and I’m comfortable. I had given up applying at the new facility and had focused on my current job, when I was contacted by a recruiter for company A. My wife and I had been looking at homes near company A the day prior, and being contacted almost felt like fate. I scheduled an interview, and ultimately got the job. However I started researching the company using Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. and discovered that while they pay generously, they do not treat their employees well. There is a high turnover rate, and a major problem involving over-working employees. Now I cannot for the life of me make up my mind. Do I leave a job that I’ve grown to love? Leave a place where I am appreciated, and compensated well? Or do I leave for a company that pays $6 more an hour, but at the risk of disturbing work/life balance and my mental health? I have never been stuck in a situation like this before. Thank you for taking the time to read. 

Pros company A- High pay, great benefits, Bonuses, purchase company stock, 

Cons company A - Robotic work, management lacks empathy, overworking 

Pros company B- Solid pay, great culture, great vacation/PTO hours, valued by management 

Cons company B - Schedule, direct supervisor is unbearable",1

955,No close Family and limited friends,"My parents split up when I was 2 and started other families:

2 half sisters (the girls) with my mom 
Half bro and sister with my dad

My mom is an active alcoholic and addict who is recently divorced from 30+ year marriage. (Me and the girls grew up with the alcoholism and addiction).
Father is 27 year retired special forces. Second wife committed suicide. Third wife is passive and took care of bro and sister after their mom (2nd wife) passed. 

Sisters (referred to as the girls) live around my mom in CO. Bro and sister live with dad in NC. I’m in Cincinnati.

I understand that the alcoholism and drug addiction may be the root of why me and the girls don’t have a relationship. As far as my father, I love him a lot. We don’t speak because he doesn’t understand my mental illness after three stays in the hospital, and denies there is anything wrong with me. Please note, I’ve lost a 72k year job, my house and my retirement because of it. He was notified every time I was in the hospital and it hurts me so much that he thinks I would throw it all away for attention. Schizophrenia runs in our family, so I’m so hurt that he doesn’t realize that’s what is wrong with me. Because I had my last episode a year ago and it was at my paternal grandmothers funeral (I thought she was with me, elated with joy, slept in my car, blared music during the funeral procession because I thought that’s what grandma was telling me to do). I was hospitalized for the last time days after her funeral. I blocked my father from my life because of his denial—needed to heal from my illness before I could take on his noise of denial. 

To sum up my fathers relationship: I’m not to have contact with my siblings until my father and I work things out. It’s a control tactic because this is what he does. I wholeheartedly believe he talked my step mom (who I loved dearly) into suicide because she wanted a divorce. He’s a manipulative asshole but he’s my father and I do love him very much.

Currently, I haven’t had symptoms and am doing much better now. I’ve found a job that pays over half of what I was making before and I’m even enrolled in school part time. I still see the patterns associated to schizophrenia, but I know they’re not real and I don’t act on them. 

I want a family. I want people to want me in their lives. I’m tearing up as I write this. I see people doing things with their family and realize the only way I’m going to have one is if I make my own. 

I’m incredibly lonely and I don’t know how to remedy this. 

If you have some input, I’ll gladly take it. I just ask that you be gentle as my ego is a bit fragile right now. Strangers on the internet shouldn’t matter, but it’s likely the only human interaction I get today.",1

118,Trying to get my life figured out but I’m too broke to live and go to school,"Hi Reddit, I don’t usually ask the internet for life advice but getting objective opinions would be nice. I work full-time as a lab assistant with no degree. I took some time off of college because my depression got to be too much and I failed most of my classes in my second semester. Since then I moved back into my parents house, wrecked my car(it was old and the breaks went out while driving it) and worked using my mom’s until I could afford a new one, and just recently I moved out with my boyfriend to a different city so I could get a better job. Staying in the town my parents live in isn’t an option since it’s in the middle of nowhere and it took 30-40 min to get to the nearest big town. Now I’m trying to go back to school part time but I can barely afford all my bills with a full-time job in my field right now and might need a second job. 

TLDR: I need to work less if I want to get my degree but I can’t afford my bills as is working full-time(40+hr/week) Any advice?",1

474,Don’t know if I should live with my dad or my mom,"I feel kinda bad about having to ask strangers on the internet about this and not being able to just talk to my family about it, but I’ve kinda reached a breaking point and I need help. My parents divorced when I was about four, and since then I’ve lived with my mom and visited my dad one weekend a month and for some school breaks. I’m 17 now, and a couple months ago I decided I wanted to move with my dad in Texas. I had been living with my mom in Georgia and going to high school there before. School was too much for me and made me horribly depressed so I did online school for the second semester in 2019. I started this school year in Austin at a new school. I thought it would be good to have a fresh start and make new friends, etc., but if I’m being completely honest, I hate it. I feel my parents in Texas are unreasonably strict. They make me go to bed at 10 PM on weekdays and 12 on weekends. Video games are generally restricted to playing for one hour, and although they’re more laid back about it now that I’m older, I usually still have to ask before I play video games. As far as school goes, they are constantly breathing down my neck. I understand that school is important and I want to pass high school as much as they want me to; but they are really overbearing. I feel like they give me no autonomy. They constantly sit me down and ask about every email they receive from the school, and micromanage everything I’m doing that’s related to school. Other than that, the house has 6 people and I share a room with an my 9 year old brother. Most weekdays I hardly get any free time if any. Free time is usually sitting down and playing Smash Bros for about ten minutes before I have to go to bed. School isn’t at all the fresh start I thought it would be and I dread going there every day. I’m horribly depressed right now. I have suicidal thoughts most days. I can’t find the nerve to tell my dad and stepmom I want to move back to Georgia, because while they don’t  treat me my age, they’re still my parents and I love them, and the thought of telling them I want to leave after only two months of living there breaks my heart and I don’t want to hurt their feelings. I already had to watch my mom cry as I drove away, I don’t want to go through that again. But the truth is, I’m not even 100% sure if I want to go back. If I go back I’ll be doing online school again, which means I won’t leave the house much. In Texas i’ve started to make a couple friends, but I have no friends in Georgia. My mom and her boyfriend are very hard to talk to because they’re not super social. There’s usually not a lot of food in the house. But I’ve found that when I’ve been visiting my mom’s from Texas the past couple months, it’s been an enormous relief being able to just relax for once, and I just feel happier. So I don’t know what to do. I really hate being here but I’ve kinda found that I won’t be truly happy anywhere I go. I think I want to go back but I’m not sure what’s best for me anymore. I’m really sorry for the huge wall of text, but I need help",1
112,Confusing Compliment,"To preface, I'm in eighth grade and so is this girl, not a super important detail I guess I just felt like it was necessary. I was on the bus ride home sitting next to a friend of mine when he opens Snapchat and quickly takes a picture of me with a pretty unflattering filter. He jokingly taps on a girl I'm interested in to send it to her, I smirked at him like he wouldn't do it but he did. They lead this really awkward conversation about not opening the picture until eventually she just does. She asks why he didn't want her to see it so much, which he replied to with, ""It was deeply disturbing."" This girl is still really confused, says it clearly isn't what I look like and pauses. My friend and I went wide-eyed when she started her next sentence saying that I was actually good looking. I see her and plenty of others dishing out compliments to female friends saying their beautiful and whatnot. Keep in mind, I don't think she knew I was watching this all play out, is there mutual interest, or was this just her being a nice person?",1

14,I (18M) recently learned something about my mother's (47F) past. And need help accepting it.,"We live in Denver, Colorado but are visiting relatives in Austin, Texas. Me, dad, mom and relatives were waiting outside the movie theater doors to enter. A few meters behind us, I noticed a very tall man with a long blond beard and a cowboy hat on. He looked at us a lot, especially my mom, when she made eye contact with him, I saw that she was red in the face and she looked very uncomfortable.

The doors opened and everyone entered the movie theater. There were not many people in the hall, we had basically taken a whole series of chairs for ourselves, the man who looked at mom very much sat on the same row, he continued to stare at us. After a while my mother went to the bathroom, not much after that the man got up and he also left the cinema.

After the movie, when we were going out, I saw the man again and he stared a lot. Mom, dad and our relatives walked home because their house was close to the movie theater. I stopped and decided to talk to the man. I first greeted him and then asked what he liked about the movie, to be nice and polite. Then I asked him who he was and why he was watching us a lot, but I meant why he was watching my mom. His name is Anderson and he said he knows my mom, I was curious and asked how, he smiled and asked me to ask her instead, I nodded and went home.

I came home, everyone was there and had dinner, I waved to my mom and asked her to walk with me a little, she first asked why, because it was unusual for me to walk with her, but I said it was about something important, so we apologized and took a walk. After a while, I asked her who Anderson is and if she knew him, I saw that she reacted strangely and became suddenly stressed. There I realized it was something big. I asked mom again and asked her to be honest, and that I would not get angry.

She was nervous, I could see it. She then began to talk about Anderson. He was her boyfriend many years ago, when they were younger and studying in college. I felt something break inside me after hearing this, but I didn't show it so she could tell me everything. Mom said that after graduating from high school in Syria, she decided to study to become a lawyer in a college in the United States, that it was something she had planned since she was in elementary school. She said that she got accepted in the college here in Austin, Texas but that she did not know where to live, they did not offer her a room so she had to arrange one on her own. Mom said it was during the summer of 1990 when she was looking for somewhere to live, because she would start studying in late August. She had a hard time finding so she got desperate, and she met Anderson at McDonald's they were talking and then mom told him her situation and he offered her a room in his apartment, he would also study at the same college here in Austin.

Mom was unsure, she wasn't prepared to live with a man, the idea was to live with a girl or alone. But after thinking about it for a few days, she had to accept because it was her only chance. So she lived with him in his apartment. She informed her parents that she had found a house with a girl, she did not say it was a man because her parents would not allow it. After two weeks living together they started dating, mom said she was not used to live like this because our values ​​and culture prohibit such. But after Anderson flirting with her and picking on her, she admitted that she got intimate and started having sex with him and they got together. Mom explained to me that they lived together as a real couple, they hung out every day, went out to restaurants, went to the movies, etc.

She said that they were together for seven years, during mom's 4 years in college and 3 years in law school. So Mom said that in 1997 after she had finished studying, she decided to go back to Syria to work there, get married and form a family. She then ended her relationship with Anderson, she broke up and left the United States to return home. Then three years later at age 28th she married my father and gave birth to me a year later in 2001. Then she became quiet and begged me not to tell anyone about her past. I saw tears in mom's eyes and she said that she is very sorry for not telling me her story and told me not to get a bad picture of her, that she's still the same person. I looked at mom and just nodded, I was completely shocked, I never thought that my mother had been with someone before my father, it felt strange. But it was after all a long time ago, but I do have bad thoughts from hearing her story. It feels like I lost respect for mom, no one knows this story, neither her family nor dad, I'm the only one who knows.

We came to the US from Syria in 2013 because of the civil war that broke out in 2011, both mom's and dad's families came also with us. We've been living in Denver, Colorado but we are visiting our relatives in Austin, the same city mom used to live in with her ex-boyfriend, Anderson. After our long conversation ended we returned home, no one said anything about what we talked about. I don't now what to do with this information, how I should be reacting and if I should tell dad about it, but if I do that, it would jeopardize mom's and dad's marriage and relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I forget about her past relationship with Anderson? How can I see their relationship as something positive and educational? How and what should I do to accept what she did before?

Other questions I would like to ask about mom is, was it a mistake to have dated and lived with a stranger in another country, which led to a seven year long relationship, where she lost her innocence / virginity, she lied to her loved ones and that her relationship over there went against the values ​​and the norms in our culture.",1

810,How do I tell my parents about my secret pet.,"TLDR: I’m hiding a bunny in my closet of my parents house how do I tell them. 

I’m still kind of new to reddit so I hope I’m doing this right. I (26F) was living with my boyfriend of 3 years last month when I adopted a baby bunny. We lived on a farm and also had 3 ducks although those were more his than they were mine. I am working on applying for a really awesome job closer to my hometown (2 hours away) and so I decided to move back in with my parents. I have set up the bunny in my large walk in closet in my childhood bedroom, but after I finish bunny proofing the rest of the room I plan to let him free roam in there. My parents were on vacation when I moved back in, and have no idea about the rabbit in my closet. They have 2 Great Danes and I have spent this week slowly introducing the dogs to the rabbit. It went very well and now they don’t seem to care about him much at all. How do i break it to my parents that I have been keeping a bunny in my closet for the past week.

I have had issues with them infantilizing me in the past and my therapist (when I had one before I lost insurance) told me to stop asking their permission and looking for their approval which I am trying to do, but at the same time I feel like hiding a bunny in my closet is kind of counterproductive so I would like to be honest and firm. I’ve also been struggling with serious depressive issues lately (unemployment for a year, boyfriend wanted to go on a break when I started the application for this very good job, the feeling like I’m losing everything and all control) and this little fluff has really given me some sense of purpose and relief. I feel like if I have to give him up I will lose it. What can I do?",1

731,"My friend has recently become depressed. She knows I have experience with depression, and she won't stop complaining.","I feel like an asshole, but I do not know what to do.   
I have been dealing with depression for years, and recently has been the best few months of my life, I have multiple days where I do not hate being alive. it's the best.

But my friend has recently hit a rough patch in her life, everything is going wrong, and she has been showing signs of depression. I encouraged her to go to a therapist. But after 4 sessions she stopped going. She was certain that it would not help and it's a waste of time (It's free here) 

So instead of going to the therapist, and venting to a proffesional, she vents to me. This is fine, I actually encouraged this, and I loved being able to help her, because I have already been there, and I could share my experiences and 'solutions'.   
At first she had real problems, I took her seriously and I replied to her in the middle of the night without fail.   
I was really helping her deal with her shit.   
But recently it went from big problems to insignificant shit. I feel that everyone's problems should be dealt with equally. Just because someone has more pain, should not mean that the person with less pain should not be allowed to complain.   
But it's starting to get tiresome. Her 'huge' problems, where she can't deal with are how I feel on some of my best days.   
It feels like she is going up to a person with their guts on the floor and starts complaining about a paper cut.   
I've been having a harder and harder time taking her seriously. I still wanna help her, but I get so annoyed when she comes to me with small stuff.

Other friends said I should stop helping her because they see that it is getting bad for my own mental health.  
But not helping her is really hard for me.   

How can I either: get her to see a therapist again?   
Or stop pestering me with stupid stuff, and only share actual problems.   
Or maybe vent insignificant stuff to other friends and go to me for the suicidal things?   
I really want to help her, but It's getting bad for my own mental health.",1

407,Lost on the whole Blizzard situation,"Hi all,

I suffer from severe anxiety which often manifests itself in the form of the need to justify myself and analyse everything I do to criticise myself. Small things have been building up lately and I feel as though I'm struggling to get by.

Without getting too political I loved the game Overwatch and decided to preorder it for the Switch. After recent news I felt compelled to cancel partially out of loss of respect for Blizzard and otherwise my anxiety would cause me to attack myself. 

This has now manifested itself in me questioning everything I do - I can't even play games by unrelated developers under the same publisher without attacking myself. I've decided to buy any games from the publisher used from now on as a personal protest.

Tldr is I keep feeling the need to justify my choices to an invisible audience and it'a killing me. Outside of therapy what should I do? I have a doctors appointment booked in a few weeks.",1
606,To architects and others: Is a BSc in mechanical engineering or a BSc in civil engineering better for pursuing a masters in architecture? How much does it actually matter? And what courses/minors should I take in preparation for pursuing a masters in architecture?,"I have a full ride at my college because my mom works for the university. My college doesn't offer a bachelors or masters degree in architecture, so I'm limited in the majors that I can take, but I would like to pursue a masters in architecture at a different university after I get a bachelors degree. What do you guys think is the best course of action that would make me look good for pursuing a masters in architecture and in the real world when.

There’s several courses of actions that I can take and I would like to know your thoughts on them and what you think is the best course of actions, as well as any advice.

1) Get a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and then pursue a 3 year masters degree in architecture.

Pros:

My university requires mandatory co-ops, so I will have about 1 year of real work experience. I thinks this could increase my possibility of getting into a good grad program (but idrk how it works).

2) Switch to civil engineering, get a degree in that and then pursue a 3 year masters degree in architecture.

Pros:

Again, I’ll have 1 year of work experience. I don’t know how much my major matters when it comes to getting a masters degree in architecture, and I also don’t know how much it would matter in the real architecture job world.

3) Bite the bullet and switch to a university that offers a bachelors degree in architecture. In this scenario I probably wouldn’t pursue a masters in architecture, but if anyone thinks that that will be useful, I’ll consider that idea. There is a university near me that offers a bachelors and masters degree in architecture, so the only real consideration is the money.

Additionally, my dad may be getting a job at the university I’m referring to, which would mean that I can get a full ride at that university since they also give tuition reimbursement to faculty members’ children, so if I could get a full ride at that university, would you recommend that option?",1
952,How do I ask my grand grandma (99) if I can have something of hers?,"Hi reddit

I’m visiting my grand grandma this Wednesday. She’s nearing 99 and her heart capacity is dangerously low. The last time I left her house, she started crying and told me to visit her again soon if I wanted to see her again before she died. My heart hasn’t healed yet, I have to admit. 

I’ve been thinking about going through her house and just kind of looking around. I was hoping to find something meaningful and ask her if I could have it when she died. Like just to remember her by. I even thought of asking her to have the little pig teddy magnet that’s on her fridge. My brother and I always misplaced it when we were at her house, and we still laugh about it. I don’t expect to get anything when she dies considering that I’m her grand grandchild. I don’t want anything either. Knowing that I’m pretty much the only person that she doesn’t cuss out, and that she talks about me to the rest of the family as if I’m the funniest person she knows, feels pretty great by itself. But what if I forget?

I don’t want to come off as rude or like I just want her things. I’ve always looked up to her as a strong woman and it’s something I really needed from time to time. Most of my friend’s grandparents have lost their minds by now and here I have my GRAND grandma still 100% aware. 

Should I ask her if I can have something of hers? Should I pick something out and ask her then? Or let her choose? I’m afraid she’ll start crying again. How do I handle this the best way possible?",1

Now H had a GF i’ll call her (C).  Now over this weekend I recently stopped being a friend with him because i realized just how much of a “sociopath” he is. So basically, he introduced me to his gf on discord, She sent me a friend request and we never really talked except to share an occasional meme or whatever, now Hayden would become abnormally disturbed and jealous by this for whatever reason. Whenever she didnt want to talk to them because they were having a fight or whatever and she messaged me a meme or whatever he got extremely jealous.   So, FF a few months and we became pretty good friends(He was a little new to the school because he was expelled in 8th grade from the jr high that moves into my HS because of making an edgy joke about burning down the school) i start to notice cuts on his wrist, he claimed “It was my dogs!” But ik his dogs are small and i dont think theyre capable of this, so i contact his gf about this to see if he’s a cutter, bc hes my friend and i care about him so i want to be there for him if he is, so she tells me all this stuff(keep in mind this was like a year ago) about how he will cut himself for attention if she ignores him, which is why she was still with him at yhat time bc she didnt want him to kill himself,   FF about 6 months or so( I dont remember the exact amount of time) he was kinda sad so i asked him what happened and he said caroline broke up with him, so 2 months later (this weekend) I redownloaded discord and was telling C jokingly about the girls hes been fornicating with as rebounds and she starts telling me and sending ss of all the psycho stuff hes been doing. H apparently took ss of a video call where (she realizes now she shouldnt have done this) but she showed her nude body to him, and he sent it to her new bf as well as threatens to send it to her new church friends as she recently is trying to become a good christian, he leaked her location to his hacker friends on discord, and harasses her about “sucking jesus’s d**k constantly. She’s tried blocking him on like 8 diff accs but he just makes more as well as uses textfree and stuff and makes new insta accs.

482,I keep dating losers.,"So here’s the situation. I’m an 18 year old female and I just moved 16 hours away from home to start college. There’s this guy who lives in the same dorm as me who I’ve been hanging out with quite a bit (we will call him Larry). I haven’t really fallen into a friend group yet so naturally I’ve been incredibly lonely since moving away from home. I know things will improve eventually and I just have to wait until I meet the right people but even so, some days seem pretty dreary. Anyways, Larry is basically my only friend right now. He can make me laugh  and he’s generally pleasant to hang out with. ( he’s not half bad looking either. ) Our relationship started to transition from friends to more than friends because there’s an undeniable chemistry between us. The problem is he reminds me of every loser guy I dated in high school. I seem to be incapable of dating  a decent guy. in my hometown I was literally known for dating unambitious, immature, potheads. It was so bad that my high school math teacher approached me and urged me to break up with boyfriend (who is now my ex boyfriend) because it was so painfully obvious that all he was doing was holding me back from reaching my full potential. I’m a straight A student and I’m involved in multiple research projects on campus. I work incredibly hard for the things that I want and I have very clear career goals that I have every intention of achieving. somehow I always end up falling for loud, dumb, immature guys who absolutely don’t have their shit together in any way whatsoever. Today Larry’s friends referred to me as “mom” several times and then I realized “oh shit I’m about end up in ANOTHER relationship where I feel more like my boyfriends keeper than partner.” I had a talk with Larry to establish some boundaries. I told him that I didn’t want to catch feelings for him and that I have no romantic intentions. I even told him that I’m no longer comfortable drinking alone with him. I know it’s the right thing to do but it was so hard to look him in the eyes and say that. A part of my really enjoys his company. I wish I could get absolutely plastered  with him on the weekends and just have fun and be in love but there’s so so so many red flags. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. For some reason I attract the exact same type of guy every time. What’s worse is I always fall for them even though I know better. I’m glad that I established boundaries with Larry but It’s definitely going to be a challenge for me to maintain those boundaries.  (P.S. I don’t really know what question I’m looking to have answered, like I said I’m in a pretty lonely place. Just wanted to share my dilemma and get some feedback because I have no one in real life to talk to about this stuff)",1

79,How much head's up should I give our neighbors that we're going to be rehoming our ducks?,"A little over a year and a half ago, my family bought three Indian Runner ducklings and made them our family pets. Over that period of time, they've become sort of the unofficial neighborhood mascots. 

We let them free range in our backyard during the day (yes, they have a secure duck house for nighttime), and people come from all over our neighborhood to feed/look at them through an adjoining garden area with a low wrought iron fence. Everyone seems to adore them and it kills me knowing that we're likely going to be moving in a few months. What's worse, we're moving out of state and can't come up with a logistical way to bring the ducks with us.

Here's what I'd like advice on:

We're about five months away from moving, but will need to rehome the ducks beforehand for showing purposes (we're in an urban area where small farm animals are allowed, but most people reserve their yards for dogs). When should I break the news that the ducks will likely be moving to a new home? I get the feeling a lot of people - especially the regulars and small kids - will want to say ""goodbye.""

I've considered asking their biggest fans if they'd like to keep the ducks themselves, but I'm convinced it's best for the girls to go to a small farm with people who already know how to properly care for them. Likewise, most of the yards in our neighborhood are small (we have an oversized lot) and I really want the girls to have a large space to forage.

Thanks for any advice!",1

I met Lucy about four weeks ago at an event, we had a great conversation and hit it off, so we exchanged numbers. Lucy and I began with a normal conversation, which turned to a relationship after about three weeks (I know that's pretty quick). We text each other early in the morning, to late at night, we tell each other that we love one another, and we tell other other that ""you're hot"" and stuff like that. Me and Lucy grow closer every day we talk, we have a lot in common and we touch and give advice to each other on personal issues. Sometimes, me and Lucy use minor sexual dialogue, but it's rare. Lucy has a lot of friends, and I mean *a lot.* Lucy's friend group consists of many males and females. I really don't care about Lucy talking to other people, those are her friends and it's not my place to be insecure about her fidelity, I trust her. Lucy's friends are wild, and dark sometimes, which is funny to me because I'm the same way. The issue I have is with a post on Instagram from one of Lucy's friends. Her friend has one post, we'll call him Dave. His post is a photo of a shadow on a wall, and this shadow is of two people kissing, or hugging, it's hard to tell. I'll add that this ***wasn't*** a stock photo, I reverse searched it. In Dave's post, he elaborates on how ""I love my girl"" and ""I do stupid shit, but I'm glad you haven't turned your back."" Lucy liked this post, but she made a joke that was completely unrelated to the post, so I feel like it might be satire, it *might*. Dave also has a few memory stories, where he refers to Lucy as ""My GF."" Just a couple of nights ago, Lucy randomly sent me a text of a screenshot of DMs between her and, what a surprise, Dave, where she was jokingly telling him that she'd ""assault him in front of his mother"" (yes, I'm serious). She sent it because she thought it was funny, and so did I. The thing is, could of asked her then and there what their relationship is, but I backed down (I know, that was lame). She doesn't know that I viewed his account prior to her sending me that screenshot. What concerns me right now is that Dave posted on his story not too long ago about how he loves Lucy, and calls her cute, with her @ and everything.

869,"Got my dong out for a girl on Omegle like an idiot, think she might have been a scammer; is there anyway she can trace who I am?","So today, being stupid and horny, I went on Omegle. No idea why, but anyway one girl was really hot, and convinced me to get my dick out and show my face along with it too. Trust me, I know how stupid this is, I just didn’t think. She asked me my age and location, so I told her my age and the country I live in. After that she told me that she’d like to see my feet, and asked if it was okay for her boyfriend to jerk to it, and after that she’d come on too. At that point I just noped the fuck out.

Looking back though it seemed like it could have been building up to a scam; asking personal details, making sure my face was pictured with my dick, etc. I didn’t give out any personal details apart from my age and country, and I didn’t add her on skype or anything like that, most of the scams I’ve seen come after that. On top of that, I wear glasses like all the time, but in this instance I wasn’t, which would make me kind of unrecognisable. However, I’m still a little concerned. Is there any way this person could track me down and, if they have recorded anything, use it against me? I’m just a little paranoid, and I don’t think there’s anyway to track down an individual simply from Omegle (at most an IP address), but I just wanted to make sure there’s no way they could figure out who I am.",1
752,"Might be switching positions, any advice?","Not sure if this is the best place to post, but here we go. 

I’ve been with the same company for 23 years. Same position for 16 years. I recently applied for another position, was offered the job, now I’m waiting for the offer in writing. I’m not sure this new position can afford my pay, so they might turn me down. Why they do not post wage ranges is beyond me. But this company isn’t that bright. 

I’m so nervous. I told my current boss I took the job and he asked why - like is there a reason I wanted to leave? I had a laundry list of items to go over with him, he listened to roughly two of them and then cut the call short. I thought he might try to fix my concerns and try to keep me, I was wrong. 

I’m so nervous. I do not like change. I love routine. 

This new job has some perks. 
I won’t manage people anymore. I can work from home. I will no longer be a part of the political management game. 

I’m so worried I won’t like the new job. What if I made the wrong choice? What if I hate working from home?What if I cannot do the job well?

Now that I’m just sitting around waiting, because the official offer with this company takes so long, I just worry.

Though she had taken in the breathtaking sights of the those magnificent behemoths, her apetite was not yet sated.  I let that little nymph offer me a bite of the forbidden fruit that is the Levant and before I came to my senses I found myself amount a camel traipsing through the Sinai, and forward unto Arabia!
To abridge a rather tedious trek across the Arabian sands wherein my jewel affected fiancée may have picked up a few artifacts to take back with us to civilization; we visited briefly with the Philistines, spent a night with the Samaritans at the foot of Mount Gerizim, and made our way to Transjordan. 
As my superstitious guide had warned me before crossing the border, we were promptly and savagely detained in Transjordan awaiting ""imminent transfer to Arabia"" based off of these outlandish claims of ""theft of historical state property.""

Latter i got auto moderated messages like that my post didn't meet any standards. Im not even sure whether this post what I'm typing now will be submitted or be rejected! I dont just understand why? 

What's the purpose of reddit? I still dont understand. 

A week before I started reddit, I have begun a new blog. So i thought that i can promote the blog in here. Then I started posting links. But I never cared whether I have been posting the same thing everywhere.  

Later I was reported as spam. I was shocked to see the notification. I never did anything illegal so why should I be reported? After that I discovered that the fault was on my side. Self promoting was banned in reddit. That was a fact that I never new about until some one told me. 

Okay! From now onwards I'm going to use reddit correctly.

Can I get the ban removed from the communities in redit?

Can anybody explain me about reddit? What type of thing when and where can I post?

Cant I share links relevant to the post? 

Please advice!",1

Then I asked him ""Can you text me when you're free? I have something I really want to talk about."", then followed it with ""Or would you like me to text you when I get out of school."", after which, he answered with ""You're being so annoying right now, I swear."". I answered with ""Sorry, I didn't mean to pressure or disturb you. I'll leave you alone if you're busy, sorry for the disturbance."". He didn't read my text but he was online a few times after I sent it.  I think he's mad at me. I can be really insistent at times without even realising it, and I admit I insisted on this in the past too, several times.

978,"We are currently living with my in-laws and my FIL just bombed my MIL with “I never loved you, it was a mistake, I stayed out of obligation, but now I wanna be happy and you need to all go bye bye.”","About 3 weeks ago (middle of September) my MIL had asked her husband if they could do something after church that Sunday. FIL suggested they go for a drive on some back roads. MIL happily agreed. It had been a while since they’d spent some good quality time alone together. 

Unfortunately, once they began their drive, FIL began casually talking about how he hadn’t been happy in a long time. He started talking about he hadn’t loved her for years.

His words, not mine). All the while my MIL and now husband is living in a hellish nightmare, she remained faithful to him. She loved him. She supported him and did not spread an ill word about him. 

She never wanted to betray the man she loved and devoted her life to and made a family with. 

I know we aren’t the only people out there going through this and was just wondering if anyone has any advice I’m willing to listen. 

Also we have a GFM set up, we are trying not to do it too much on Facebook bc FIL is on there and pretty active. I’ve posted on r/Charity, Pinterest, Twitter, but we don’t have a lot people we know that we can send it to and I’m trying to find the best way for us to broadcast this without literally going to the news. Lol. 


If there is a better place for me to post this please let me know.

EDIT 
HERE IS WHAT I WROTE FOR GFM

- I posted a pic of my MIL and 3 yr old daughter -

The woman you see before you, Pam, is my Mother-In-Law, but honestly she’s more like the mom I never had. She is the sweetest, most patient and loving woman you will ever meet. You can’t help but find hope when she talks to you about how her prayers for her friends and families are being answered and getting good reports. She’s a beautifully inspiring floral arranger and crowned Official Craft Queen by all who know her. She is a loving, dedicated and selfless wife and mother of nearly 40 years and grandmother of a beautiful 3 year old. (My daughter)

Pam is one of the strongest women you will ever meet, though you might not guess it when you look at her. She has mild cerebral palsy as well as a few other health issues that severely limit her mobility and have been instrumental in isolating her and forcing her to rely on others for assistance. Pam wears a leg brace and uses a walker to help her maintain balance and stability while on the go. She really struggles with normal size steps so her husband had actually built her a half-step stair case into their house at one point. 

Her husband was active in their church for many years, preaching, playing the drums and helping in other yearly events at the church. He was involved with a small Christian band made up of members of the local community who played all over the local region. 

Their only son is my husband of 7 years. Along with our daughter, the 3 of us have found ourselves living with my in-laws due to some unexpected life changes. I am currently unable to work at the moment due to severe CPTSD, so we are already catching our breath. 

About 3 weeks ago (middle of September) my MIL had asked her husband if they could do something after church that Sunday. FIL suggested they go for a drive on some back roads. MIL happily agreed. It had been a while since they’d spent some good quality time alone together. 

Unfortunately, once they began their drive, FIL began casually talking about how he hadn’t been happy in a long time. He started talking about he hadn’t loved her for years.

His words, not mine). All the while my MIL and now husband is living in a hellish nightmare, she remained faithful to him. She loved him. She supported him and did not spread an ill word about him. 

She never wanted to betray the man she loved and devoted her life to and made a family with. 

He barely took care of her basic every day and special needs. In the new house he is renting, she has been having to bathe in the sink because she doesn’t have the proper handles to safely get into the tub. SHE DIDNT TELL ME FOR 3 MONTHS. FIL refused to do anything to allow her to just take a shower in their new home. (We have ordered the necessary attachments for the tub and currently waiting for them to arrive.)

Now FIL wants her gone. But not just her, all of us. See, we are currently finding ourselves all living under one roof...he refuses to leave. While we understand there may be things we can do to force our hand, we would prefer to just peacefully go without any more heartache or trauma brought onto ourselves. The pain has been dealt...we just want it to stop. 

My husband, Mother-In-Law and I have decided that this pain and hurt stops with us and my daughter. We have decided to join together as a household, as a family, to take care of each other and to help each other heal and grieve and mourn this world shattering news. We will be starting over with love and care for each other, but we need some help getting started. 

My MIL obviously had no idea so its not like she had herself a hefty “after Husband dumps me” fund set aside. My husband was working for his dad up til recently due to the stress-fullness of the situation. With me unable to work, now we have no income. 

We have a plan to move to a nearby town that’s a bit larger than where we are currently to allow us to find decent, handicap accessible housing without too much difficulty in finding work quickly, especially with holidays coming up. People will be hiring and we can catch our bearings a bit. 

We just need to get out and into our own place. We are humbly asking for your help. Even just a little bit helps. If everyone who saw this gave $5 it would only take 800 people to give $5 and we’d have our goal of $4,000. 

Please share this with as many people as possible. Help me and my husband give this incredible woman the life she deserves by giving us a boost to get started. We love you momma. We are going to be ok. ❤️",1
592,I’m getting a promotion soon and my business plans on negotiating a salary. Who should I talk to?,"Hi, 

This is a huge first step for my career. I’ve worked hard these past 4 years to make my way to become a manager. I’m 23 years old, with no college degree and have been working in the restaurant business for awhile. I’ve been a server, bartender, cook, food prepared, and supervisor these past few years, and have worked in 2 restaurants. 4 if you include a pizza place as a driver and a fast food restaurant when I was 18. I fit in this business, I can be the first one in and last one to leave if it comes down to it. I can be in the kitchen, bar, or just generally in the front of house talking to guests. I work with an old manager who became a GM somewhere new and hired me as a bartender with plans for me to move up (which a few months ago I became a supervisor). The other day she called me, letting me know that there is a position for manager available and she is strongly pushing for me and wanted to ask if I was ready. OF COURSE IM READY. I’m excited to say the least. She told me that our regional manager should be talking to me in the next few weeks and I should be thinking about what salary I expect. Really I’m not sure what I should ask for. I have about 3k in debt which I want to get rid of as soon as possible because I’m getting married at the beginning of next year and could possibly be growing my family in a year or two. I don’t have any relatives that I can talk to about this. Is there a sub reddit that specializes in this kind of thing or is this a good place to start. I just need help. Thank you.",1
569,Boss told me a coworker is leaving because they are moving. Found out they're actually going to a competitor. Should I tell my boss what I found out&gt;,"Gotta be vague here - I work for a small office of a big company. My department (4 people) handles some pretty sensitive stuff.

In a meeting with my boss last Wednesday, I was told that the newest of us in our department (he'd been here maybe 6 months) had just put in his 2 week notice. We have to decide how to divide his work among the rest of us. My boss said he was moving to a city in an adjacent state.

Coincidentally, my sister-in-law works for one of our biggest competitors. I want out to dinner with my brother last night and he mentioned how his wife told him that they had just hired away a {my job title} from {my company}. I verified the name with her later, and it's him.

Should I mention this to my boss on Monday morning? I don't know our company's policy but I would think you're supposed to tell your boss if you're leaving for a competitor, if your job entails knowing sensitive financial data (which ours does).

2,What do I do if my parents keep calling me autistic?,"Hi, very confused person here.

Ever since I was a kid my parents used to tell people that I have autism whenever I behaved a little coy or
make eye contact.

However, their comments about this have recently become a LOT more frequent, to the point where whenever I can’t hear something someone said or I understood something the wrong way or I’m just, idk, me being awkward, they rub in my face how I’m autistic.

It’s just so WEIRD and I don’t know where it’s coming from. I don’t think I have autism? I mean, I’ve never noticed anything, and neither have any of my friends or relatives or anyone besides my parents, and they’ve never spoken to a doctor either.

At first I thought they might be joking or tastelessly and misguidedly insulting me, but they sound really really serious and convinced about the topic, as though it’s one of the great truths of the universe.

No offence to actual autistic people, I really hope that my lack of education on the topic isn’t accidentally insulting or hurting you, please tell me if I did something wrong, but at this point I’m just a little bit sick of their constant comments. I don’t UNDERSTAND what this situation is about.

Like, are they right? Should I see someone? Or what the hell is going on???",1

5032,Felt pressured when cub scouts solicit $60 popcorn in my store in front of my customers.,"When two boys approached my market booth this evening, I thought they were going to buy the product I was selling. Turned out, they were there to ask me to buy their popcorn as a donation for cub scout. When I asked, how much was the popcorn, the mother came and said it was $60 dollars for a box. I mean, come on $60  dollars for a box of popcorn? When I said, that's too much, the mother came close and said ""we also have $30 popcorns but you don't have to buy, you can just donate"" Out of the pressure of having two kids in front of my booth and my customers, I couldn't help but reluctantly give some money. The mother then told her kids that they were doing such good jobs for being great salesmen. They then went around the market and did the same thing.

Now that I think about it, is this really how we should teach our kids about working hard and making money? I mean I can't really blame the kids of course but something in this whole setup of asking for donation just felt so wrong to me. I just felt that I was cornered in front of my customers to pressure me into giving money. Not just me I guess, but all the vendors in the vicinity. I mean who can say no to these 6 year olds and the parents exploit that to get money. Is it just me or anybody else feel this way about solicitations for 'kids'. It would have been better if these kids setup their own booth and sell stuff that is of value to other people. I feel like that is a more valuable lesson to teach our kids instead of asking for 'donation' by selling way overpriced stuff that has little value but gets bought because they are kids and it's for a 'good' cause.",0

He wanted my bank info (obviously) and I was like ok yeah sounds like a great deal, but then I just stopped emailing him and forgot about it. Things got WEIRD after that, I think he must of hacked the info on my school account, bc he texted my number, texted my moms number, and then told me he knows my social security number and is going to post it online. He had the first 3 digits of my SS number correct too. Is this guy legit? I don't know if this is something I should report or what I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: it may help to know that his original email said something like this ""I will pay you $400 a week if you call me daddy"", to which I replied ""sounds like an offer I can't refuse, how do I sign up"", to which he said ""send banking info"", to which I replied ""ok"" and attached a photo of a giant horse cock instead of my banking info.

needless to say I stopped replying after that and never replied since.

749,How do I urge my stereotypical black colleague at work to be more productive?,"Hi guys,

So I've been working at this IT company for about a year now, things are alright but most of the times it's stressful and there's a lot of work to do. Two months ago, a new member joined the team, and to put it as bluntly as possible, he's exactly the kind of lazy/noisy you'd expect an African American to be. I sh\*t you not, all he does all day is watch NBA on Youtube and play 'music' by tapping his hand on the desk. He also ALWAYS salivates on his keyboard while staring at the computer. I've tried to report this to my supervisor but he says any wrong thing done or said against black people can now get everyone kicked out. How do I handle this myself?",1

361,How do I deal with my superiour who is inconsiderate towards my school scedule? (Part-Time work),"TL;DR at bottom

A year ago, when I was 18, I have decided to get a part-time job (my first job ever), while I was studying for my A Levels online. I found a website for a restaurant near where I live, which advertised for 1-2 days per week, mainly on weekends as a server. This will be important later.  They organised a dinner shift where I could work with other servers to see what it was like. The head server (guess  that's what she is called) made me a job offer which I accepted.

We work in shifts. Servers can write the times and days they are available into an excel sheet in the dropbox and the head server chooses on which days someone should come to work. We know the shifts about 1.5 months in advantage. 1 Month after I joined, I noticed that I had to show up an 1.5 hours before the restaurant opens. I contacted the head server and she said that that's the shift for cleaning the whole resuatrant minuns the kitchen with another server. I didn't know that cleaning was part of the job, as I had only seen the serving part, but I thought that was just my inexperience and that that is normal.

We have a whatsapp group where new rules/regulations are discussed. Pretty much every day, several new rules are presented and it's expected that we know each one of them by heart. We are also bartending and all the cocktail receipes are also to be learnt by heart. If you can't keep up, because you are studying for uni, you get yelled at and berated. I think it's disproportionate.

What is most problematic to me, though, is how inconsiderate they are. Every single server with the exception of the head server, is part-time. The uni semester has recently started and the restaurant now faced a problem: Because they have promised 1-2 shifts a week, half of their servers are students, who are unable to go to work that often next to school.

When I looked up my new shift plan, I was shocked. I am supposed to come to work 4-5 days a week for the next month or so, while being a student in the most important phase. And sometimes, I finish at 10pm or later (arriving at home around 11pm) and start next day at 10am. I already have completed a 5-days week and I must, say, I am broken. Mentally and physically, I am exhausted. I have tried studying as much as I can. Even the week after, I was unable to move. I am too exhausted to sleep. I haven't eaten in days, have lost all my appetite.

I am quite mad about my tasks, as I didn't think that my life would be like this: Cleaning for hours, being yelled at, work into exhaustion, when I'm supposed to learn. I have one of, if not the most important exam in my entire life in 7 months. And the head server, who writes our shift plan, was SURPRISED, when I told her that 5 times was way too much. In her mind, we are supposed to be ready to work full-time if needed. They want full-time work for the costs&amp;benefits of a part-time worker.

I am not ready to lose my future to this place. I have two options for the next shift plan:

1. Fill it out as usual. The head server knows that 2-3 times a week is my limit. I have told her. Hope this time she will be more considerate.
2. Pretend that I'm only available twice a week. This is a good option, but I am scared of being berated by the head server. She had already called/messaged me about why I couldn't come on certain days.

So, these are my two options? Which one should I choose? In my country, employers write a statement pretty much on how good of a worker you are for further reference. I am afraid that my employers will conclude that I'm just a lazy young person. This is also the reason I haven't talked much about this issue with my surrounding, as they might think I'm just complaining out of lazyness and being a spoiled teen.

TL;DR The shift plan for my part-time work makes it unable for me to study for my A Levels. I am both afraid to piss off my inconsiderate superior and to fail my exam because of my schedule. I am exhausted.

Thank you",1

At this point I lost it with her and took out my anger on my other friend's. After a few hours she apologized and I like forgave her ig and we kinda made peace  and she also told me that she wasn't gonna go with that dude. The next day she tells me that she was going to the movie with some ""friends"" but ended up going with the same guy afterall(she made up this big web of lies to hide this lol). I got to know this and started avoiding her , kind of. So today she comes to me and asks me whether I wanted to watch the thing with her(pity again) , I declined saying that ""I don't wanna watch"". The thing is that I had kinda asked her close friend if she wanted to go(she's my friend too and I asked her only cause I had no one else to go with) and we decided that it wouldn't be right to go to the thing after what happened today(the friend wanted me to go with her but I told her about what had happened). So now she has started ignoring me cause I don't know why and I'm extremely confused cause none of this was my fault . Asking her close friend was prolly wrong on my part but I honestly just wanted to watch the thing. Confusion over 9000 lol:/",1

682,college exam or wedding ?,"hi everyone 

i made a big oopsie and didn’t check the dates of my midterm Week 1 to see if they coincided with my relatives wedding i’m going to in a couple weeks. the thought only crossed my mind last night and the first thing i did was email my professor. he basically said a wedding isn’t an emergency and he would’ve been happy to write me a new test otherwise , but it isn’t the case, and i didn’t bring it up to him earlier (which idk if he would’ve accommodated anyway since weddings don’t seem crucial in academia) 

the exam is in 2 weeks as well as the wedding. since he can’t and won’t accommodate me, i will receive a zero, and even if i got A’s on everything else, i would still fail the class. so i’m considering dropping it and picking up another class. the only thing is that it really stresses me out to have to catch up in a new class in the middle of the quarter , but i would still graduate at the same time so it doesn’t affect me too much in the long run. 

another option is just not going to the wedding, which my mom posed, but imo, it’s a family event, and if i were to compare the both, the wedding is a one time thing and i can retake the class next quarter. what would y’all do?",1

658,"Mother caught having sex with 16 y/o daughter's boyfriend, authorities aren't doing anything because family won't admit accusation. What can I do to help?","This is a situation I have been following from a close friend of mine. I would like to help in anyway from my position since they're just ""waiting to see what happens"". I wish I could have made this post earlier but I thought action was being done but circumstances have changed to where I feel like if I don't soon then nothing will get done.

Some background to story; the daughter over a year ago started dating this boy (17 now) who came from broken homes (parents killed themselves, nobody wanted to take them in but his aunt and uncle felt they ""had"" to and never showed any care to him. They also weren't a fan of the daughter's parents since they were a lot more easy going with their kids, their Daughter (16) and Son (12) have a history of major panic attacks and situations with severe depression and anxiety so their parents let (only) their Daughter smoke weed if she needs to. The kids learned a lot of their emotions though because of early help with therapy and overall the brother and sister are just EXTREMELY good kids, very well spoken, polite, smart and involved in school and sports. Through the time the daughter and him were dating, he had grown a bond with the Daughter's parents to where they treated him like a son and supported him through school since it was in a rougher area and he had a troubled past and no real support system since his guardians didn't care for him. So the Daughter's Mom actually knew him before the daughter and him got together because she had worked as a Parent Educator at their high school in one of his classes. She would always tell us stories and how she bonded and joked around with the kids and how all her daughter's friends would call her ""mom"" when she walks around campus.

So here's when things started to take more of a turn; so last Fall, the Daughter's Boyfriend called someone a racial slur and caused a small riot in their school where he was then expelled. His guardians ended up kicking him out (which how do you even do to a teenager) so the Daughter's parents took him in crashing on the couch and that's literally where he'd live everyday till the terrible end. Meanwhile, a girl who's boyfriend was the one who fought her's, contacted the daughter that she was going to get jumped so the parent and the school got involved so the girls and their daughter (high school justice at it's peak) got suspended. So you think that the Daughter's parents would be more on his ass to get him on the right track, right? Nope, at a family bbq (about mid-July) he drank so many beers, having them stacked on in display in front of him, that he threw up all over the floor. Do you know what's crazy too? He didn't get in trouble either, my friend's family members and their friends were all weirded about through out the whole night that he was just casually getting drunk in front of all of us, he even got up at one point and started dancing and grinding on his Girlfriend's Mom ""jokingly"". OH, and the daughter wasn't even AT the bbq. She came home late from going to a bonfire with her friends. Then he was drinking at another family party again shortly after that. BUT THINGS GET MORE WILD. So the daughter's mom started telling some of the young adult potheads in the family that the Daughter's Boyfriend was selling wax carts. THEN 2 months later, she's trying to find where to get weed for him because he ""needed"" it.


Now in the mean time, you might be thinking what was everyone thinking including the husband. So throughout this past year, we have been noticing that she has been acting more off and we've been seeing her less. Started talking less to her friends and her husband had been noticing a lot of signs that she was losing interest in him; talking to him less, sleeping in the living room away from him, and even a situation where she was dancing on another guy grinding at a family's wedding in the beginning of the year. Finally about 2-3 months ago, she said she lost feelings for him and she doesn't want to do marriage counseling, it was because he works so much and is never home (they're paying off a house they bought and supporting 2 children while he does construction work for hours on end), and she felt like she ""missed out on her 20's"" (They were high school sweethearts, since 15 y/o they've been together). He was devastated of course, tried talking and figuring out how he could fix this and so on. About a week or 2, later she ""tries"" to give it another chance only to say never mind.


So a little bit of time later, about 3 weeks ago, the Daughter and her Dad were having a day together while his Son was at his friend's house sleeping over and they decide to go home. When they walked in, her Mom ran out her SON'S room with NO CLOTHES ON to her room and the Daughter's boyfriend naked as well on the bed. The daughter starts beating up her mother badly and the father calls the Mom's Brother to come get the Mom out of the house. The Brother gets there and everyone is just yelling, spitting, and screaming at her. The Daughter's X (boyfriend, we'll call him ""X"" now) goes to the guardian's house, the mother gets kicked out and moved into her mother's home, and the rest of the family decided to move out and sell their home immediately because they couldn't bare living in there anymore. They now live a lot more farther out because of this, but sadly it was the same area the Mom was staying at.


SO HERE'S WHERE WE GET MORE INTO THE LEGAL PORTION / AFTERMATH:
The Dad and Mom met once again after that to sign the papers to sell the house (where she'll get half the money in profits) where she was still beaten up from the Daughter, she starts breaking down in the middle of the street with the Dad saying he's way past her cause she ruined the family. The rest of the family before (recently) moving in to their new area, stayed at their relatives house.

So from my point of view and the people I knew involved, we were waiting on someone to report it whether it was the Husband, the Guardians, the Brother, the neighbor who over heard and knew the family, SOMEBODY. But no one did, someone tried to report it to the school district she worked at but they ""didn't want to hear it"", finally someone did 2 WEEKS LATER to the police and cps, and the Daughter's X and Guardians had apparently moved to Arizona so kinda hard to investigate and find someone from another state. Not only that, the Mom apparently had continued to message the Dad which EVERYONE was advising him not to but apparently it was to stay in contact for the house situation... Apparently not, as when the Mom got a new number, she gave it to the Dad only for the Dad to send it to one of her ex-Friends and say, ""Oh can you message Mom, because she's lonely and does't face any friends"". MAYBE CAUSE SHE MOLESTED YOUR DAUGHTER'S UNDERAGE BOYFRIEND. SO, the Friend called the Mom and they talked about how it was just a mistake and they got the story all wrong and it wasn't as bad as it- BULL. The friend falls for it and today the friend had went on a hike with the Daughter which I'm honestly very concerned about.

We found out recently as well too that apparently the Mom had PICKED UP THE KIDS from the relatives house parking as far as she can to have them walk to her. Apparently she was the one who drove them to their new area where they were starting school. The Son staying with the Mom and her mom, the Daughter staying with her dad in another family's place while they finalize their new place. Reasons why I'm bring this up as well is because I feel like everyone is in a VERY emotional and vulnerable place and through what everyone is witnessing, it seems apparent that she's manipulating everyone so they can go back and be ok.

The police ended up going to their old house where the Dad was home and the Dad didn't give anything at all away, even the Daughter got extremely frustrated when a relative tried to talk to her that this isn't ok but the girl has just been thru so much with this situation and having to give her life away and all new dynamics, along with the son too where they already had a established life. One relative called out the Dad for falling to her traps but he just argued back on the relative's past mistakes that had nothing even remotely similar to this situation. The Dad had even agreed to not even put his kids in therapy because it'll raise suspicion but the Kids literally need this way more than anyone in this situation for what they've been through and going through currently. So because the Daughter or Dad won't admit to anything and the Daughter's X can't be found in the area, the police and CPS can't do anything from what I've head.

I feel there has to be something, IF ANYTHING, I can do to bring some type of justice. it's not right for someone to walk away from this when she's caused so much pain and damage to everyone involved. My friend and their family are afraid to get more involved as they fear they'll lose their relationship with the Dad, Daughter, and Son as they're all extremely close to them but me being an outsider knowing all about this situation, knowing that I can get address, and provide places to look into including why they sold the house and moved out of the blue, why the Mom left her job, knowing message conversations they can look into.

360,How do I make Japanese friends when I'm a gaijin?,"Hi guys, I made this account just to post this. I hope I can get some advice.

So, I have trouble getting friends at school, I don't know why. It is probably because of me being a Japanese-American.

Anyway. Here we go. For some context, my mom is Japanese/Okinawan, and my dad is American. My dad used to teach English for three years in a small middle school in Okinawa in the mid 90s and there he met my mom. And they married, and they both went to America in the late 90s. 

I was born in America, in 2003. I didn't know a lot of Japanese and grew up knowing few songs, phrases, and I don't know how to read and write. 
Soon, maybe when I was around 13, my mom and dad had planned for us three to go back to Japan, in Okinawa and I'm not sure if it's temporary or permanent, but my mom and dad plans that we'll be all living there permanently because of more opportunities. So, I got enrolled into a Japanese learning center for preparation. 

In the summer of 2019, all of us went to Okinawa. And I got enrolled into 10th grade. Most people in my school usually see me as American, and don't speak to me because they think I speak English only, and no Japanese. They considered me a gaijin and I feel so alone. 
It really hurts to be here. I don't like it and I'm afraid that this might be affecting my mental health. The people here don't really see foreigners a lot and even though I speak to them in Japanese, the others here don't make an effort to talk to me. I feel like an outsider. I want to boost my confidence and I don't want it like this. I feel so lonely. I'm afraid that my life in Japan will be like this forever. Some people actually talk behind my back at school and though I just ignore them, it actually hurts me a lot. I'm having an identity crisis, wherein I don't know where I belong. Can anybody give me advice on how to befriend people who consider me a gaijin? How do I make new friends in a new country?",1

702,I'm completely lost on what to do in this anxiety fueled drama,"This is probably gonna be a really long post and there's probably gonna be several mistakes as it's 1.18am currently and I'm exhausted, but I'll leave a TL;DR at the bottom if you don't have time to read through the whole mess of a post that this is gonna be.

Ok, so a good place to start is a rough idea of everyone involved. There's myself, I'm a 15 year old British highschooler diagnosed with anxiety. There's the person I'll refer to as B, who is a guy I go to school with, and until a short while ago I thought I was friends with. He seems to suffer with some form of anger management problem and possibly depression. Then there's C, my closest friend, who dated B at one point. Finally there's my parents, who are very caring towards me (not really a bad thing).

So the situation starts around a month ago. Me, B and two other friends are sat outside school at break time, and everything seems casual. B seems calm and in a good mood, as does everyone else. B is drinking a bottle of pepsi and eating the crumbs out of a small pringles can. At one point, B taps the base of the now empty can so it makes a drum noise. It's around now that I have the idea that leads to the biggest problem.

In my pencil case, I carry a small art compass with a very sharp end. As in this things around a centimetre long and the point can easily pierce metal. So in a moment of 'I'm bored and this'll be fun to do', I let B borrow the compass to stab holes in the pringles can.

B seems pretty happy with the discovery that stabbing holes in a metal object makes a satisfying noise. He continues to pierce holes in the can fit around 5 minutes. It's around this point where I make my mistake.

B still has his bottle of pepsi left on the table. Just for the laughs and while B is distracted, I shake up his bottle so the next time he opens it, it'll fizz up. I know this is a bit of a dick move but you need to understand B has done this to me and my other friends countless times before. Since year 7, a running thing in our friend group is messing with others food/drink when their back is tuned. I've had many an item be ruined that way for me before, and B has had many of his stuff end the same way.

So after I've shaken Bs pepsi, I nip inside to the toilet. As I get back outside, I see B has moved and my other friends are nowhere to be seen. So I go up to him to ask where they've gone. Immediately, he asks if I shook up his pepsi, which I own up to right there and then.

This is where shit really hits the fan. B lifts the pepsi bottle, and chucks around 3/4 of its content onto me in the span of around 10 seconds. I'm too shocked to move while he's pouring it, but I eventually back away and turn around. Notably irritated as now all my clothes are wet and my hair is sticky, I mutter 'jeez, someone's in a pissy mood'.

Again, a bad move.

B starts walking towards me at quite a fast speed. It's important that you know that B is very strong, I've seen him win many a fistfight before. He knows how to win. I, however, am very weak and can't land a good punch for the life of me. I've tried and failed before. So when B is charging towards me repeatedly saying aggressively 'Say that again!', I back away and try to take back my claims. 

Call me a pussy, but I didn't feel like going home with a broken nose and 6 teeth out. 

So I'm there like 'i was kidding, I'm just kidding', and he's still walking at me, pepsi still in hand. His friends are yelling at him to stop. Eventually be does, and just opts to throw the pepsi bottle and it's 1/4 liquid content as my back as I walk away. 

I later find out that he originally took his anger out on another one of my friends who he thought was responsible. He ended up with both of his hands grazed after B pushed him off the bench.

Also note that B still has my long tip compass.



Now onto the second part of this situation and the main problem at the moment. 

So it's been about a month since the initial incident. I decided to sweep it under the rug and forget about it as best as I can as I don't want my face decked in. But it ends up being brought up again three days ago.

So it's Friday, the friend group are all in the school canteen, and we're all casually talking. B brings up how the lesson before, he'd been annoying one of his classmates with '(my name)'s compass'. At which point he brings it out if his inside blazer pocket. 

Now, this compass is a very useful item to me and I could do with it back. I'm an aspiring artist, so a tool that  can draw circles is very useful. A good quality compass like the one he'd nicked costs roughly £10, and I don't have any spares that don't have faulty pencil locking systems.

So I ask him casually if I can have it back

He responds no, as it's payback.

I say he owes me it as surely throwing most of the bottles remains onto me was enough 'revenge'.

Apparently this is the wrong answer, as he says 'if you want to have it back, you're gonna have to take it yourself'. While holding the compass with only the top showing in the grip of his hand. I interpreted this as him saying 'if you try and get it I'll stab you'

This may be wrong. I don't know. But I start freaking out. 

I yell at him about how it's not fair of him to do this. About how he always treats everyone in the friend group like shit (which isn't a lie, you already know what happened to one of my other friends during the pepsi incident, and I'll note more later). 

He seems taken a back, but sarcastically tells me to 'calm down, chill out, take a deep breath'. 

I storm out of the canteen, cursing him under my breath as I go.

I didn't let him see but for the rest of the day, the interpreted stab treat played on my mind like mad. That thing could easily kill me if he hut me in the right place several times over. He's shown his violent tendancies before, why would this time be any different. 

I return home after venting to C about the incident. I should note that only the day before, B said he hoped C would 'overdose on black tar heroin and die in a fucking car crash'. She cried about this the next lesson. And rightfully so. C has done a lot to try and be friends with B, but he still seems determined to hate her and cursed her out every time has the chance.

So I get home and tell my parents about what happened. They don't do much at first but tell me to just ignore him.

The next night I don't sleep much at all. I'm scared he'll come after me and stab me on Monday. I have several panic attacks and only get 2 hours sleep total.

Next night, too exhausted to thing, I sleep fine.

But tonight, again, I'm freaking out. In the mist of a panic attack, I wake my parents up and tell them I'm scared about what he'll do. They tell me that this morning, they'll email the school and tell them what's going on. My mum is notably fuming and wants B expelled. 

I don't know if I want this

B was a dick. But I was a dick too. 

But I'm scared he'll come at me.

And I don't wanna get stabbed.

He's said many a bad thing to me before. This classes as bullying.

But it will tear apart my friend group. Some will side with B, some, probably less, will side with me.

And I don't know what I'm meant to do.

TL:DR: B and me end up in fight, he steals my sharp art compass and passively threatens to stab me with it. My parents want to get him kicked outta school but it will hurt my friend group. I don't know what to do.",1
747,"Girl wants to hang out, but I don't know her?","So yesterday I went to Walmart and bought a few things.

Today she told me she would love to hangout. Wtf? I thought she just wanted to play some games online. I don't know anything about this person so i don't want to invite a stranger from Walmart to my apartment and who knows if she might try and set me up and scope my place out and try and get some dude to rob me or something.

520,I need help with school,"First thing: Fuck high school

I’m a Sophomore at a tiny charter school in the Southwestern USA. We don’t even have a football team. No football Field, baseball field, soccer field, and only a tiny basketball court. We have to wear these horrible uniforms. This is my first year at the school and after a full quarter, I literally have two friends. I’m generally pretty personable, but there is a huge religion near me (Mormons) who all form groups and don’t let anyone in. 
The classes are slow, and I have to teach everything to my self at home anyways. I took the ACT a few weeks ago and I got a 32. I’m seriously considering dropping out. I just can’t stand school anymore, I want to drop out and just do online college. The classes will be harder and more apt to my abilities. I just need advice on what to do. I can’t imagine being at this school for another 7 months. What do you all think I should do? Thank you all so much",1

402,I filled in an anonymous review at work and it backfired,"So my workplace started emailing us these ‘anonymous’ review things a couple of months ago and I always filled mine out with positive things as I never believed it was actually anonymous. 

But a couple of weeks ago an incident occurred with a certain department who are prone to bullying. Slightly fed up of this I filled in a review that night and wrote about the incident and basically said this kind of thing happens all the time. Sorry I don’t want to give exact details because I know my boss uses reddit.

Didn’t think this through obviously because the next day my boss came storming up to me and asked if I had wrote it, I denied it because he was angry. He went on a rant about how whoever wrote it was completely wrong for saying it and cowardly for hiding behind anonymity.

Anyway I’ve been off work for the past few days on holiday and now I’m absolutely dreading going back in and facing him, he absolutely knows it was me (he was giving me the side eye for the full day after the rant) and I don’t know what to do. I really regret saying what I said and I think my boss will tell everyone. My friends think I should sit him down and explain what I meant and why I feel this way but I really don’t know and every time I think about facing him I burst into tears. I just don’t understand why someone would ask for criticism then get so angry when they receive it.",1

191,What would you do if you had only a couple of days more to live?,"I'm going to die of rabies. Of motherfucking rabies because it couldn't be something else like getting shot or drowning. [Six days ago I played with some random stray puppies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dfh5k5/how_to_know_if_an_animal_had_rabies_yesterday_i/) and one of them managed to lick me inside of the mouth, it had me worried because the pup could have been sick but since I couldn't and I still can't afford to go to the doctor so I had to brush it off.

Six days later I'm currently feeling like shit. I have the worst headache I've had in my life, my ears feel like they're about to explode, I can't hear almost anything from one of them and 1000 mg of tylenol is not helping. I feel weak and nauseated, I have problems holding normal objects, my throat is starting to hurt like if I had the flu and my mind is foggy, even texting and reading hurt. Every hour I feel more tired and more dizzy. Even breathing makes me nauseated.

I have rabies, I guess, I don't really know. But if I do then there's nothing that can be done about it because once the symptoms appear it can't be cured. God fucking damn it. I have nobody to speak about this because I don't feel comfortable talking to my biological family and telling my friends wouldn't help, I'm just going to make them feel helpless without reason because they can't do anything about me besides worrying. I don't want them to feel responsible about anything of this.

So I'm here, half telling you this because I don't know who else to tell, and half asking suggestion about what to do before dying because, I don't know, if I'm going to die I better prepare myself for it. And if it's not rabies, at least I did something besides laying on my bed and job hunting like I was doing before this shit.

But if you want me to be honest, I'm convinced I won't get better from this, I just know it. It's not like when you get too sick but you know you'll be fine, this feels different, it feels like it's the end. I'm taking it well because I was already dealing with suicidal thoughts before this so it's more a ""huh at least i don't have to worry about my problems anymore"" than however I'm supposed to take it.

**So... Suggestions? What would you do if you thought you were about to die? Could you help me to make a list of tasks and things that I won't regret if I don't die, besides deleting my history and hiding my porn? Thank you.**",1

848,Hey everyone need some advice about an ex girlfriend,"Hey everyone so my situation is this - my ex broke up with me in the car while driving home from an expensive date I organised for us both about 6 weeks ago now. Eventually after an emotional drive home, once I pulled into the driveway I noticed her mum packing up her stuff  so I had to leave as that would of been to hard to watch that. I left for an hour and when I came home everything was gone besides my stuff. Fast forward 48 hours and she’s bailed the country to go to Bali and left me with the house. So I stayed in the house which we were renting but I couldn’t do it after the one night because I had to many memories in that house with her. So I moved out.
So I didn’t live in the house for the last 3 weeks we had in the lease and she wants the money from me for the 3 weeks rent. I told her yes when I get paid I will give her the 600 dollers I owe for the rent. Deep down I didn’t feel the need to pay it since I wasn’t living there but I know I signed a contract and have to pay it BUT fast forward to my pay day and she called me 189 times in a row - Yes 189 times and she harassed my mum and sister and my best mate about the money. Now I thought fuck it that’s not normal behaviour that harassment so she can wait and I’ll pay her when I really have money. So I messaged her and said I will pay you next week once my pays in and then we are sorted. However I said if you harras me again I won’t give you a cent. So fast forward a week The day for my pay came through and sure enough she called not just me my mum dad and 2 siblings 50 times in a Row. So I’ve decided fuck it i told her if she would do that I won’t be giving her a cent and she did so I don’t think I’m going to give her a cent. Can someone give me some advice on this because I’m very close to reporting this to the police because it’s not normal and she’s harassing my whole family and friends who have nothing to do with this situation.

900,Should I risk my relationship (and my inheritance) with my grandma and take away her car keys?,"My grandma can't drive for the life of her and has been in many accidents, she has never hurt anybody but I'm scared that she'll get herself or somebody else killed. Her hands shake and jerk while driving which causes her to be all over her lane, she often swerves out of her lane, she runs into any and everything and will often drive over the curb. She gets honked at all the time. I drovr with her quite a bit before I got my license and she would always look at me while she drove and needed to make eye contact with me while she was talking, which was all the time. The least of her problems is the fact that she goes incredibly slow.

Shes been in 6 minor car accidents and 1 hit and run, where she ran into the barrier on the road and damaged a sign, she then took off and went to work. The police showed up at work and questioned her about it, she explained that she didn't realize that she needed to report that and they let her off. The problem is that because she's a sweet old lady they keep letting her off and they need to stop and report her. She ran into the freaking barrier, that's not easy to do. 
The problem is that nobody is willing to take away her keys. My mom has tried to talk to her but she'll get really upset, none of her siblings are willing to back her up and take away her keys. If somebody dies try that without support I don't doubt that she will not talk to them and possibly cut them off. Also not near as important and I'll  sound like a jerk saying this but I'll also risk loosing my inheritance, which is a fair amount 😬

351,Recovering from a toxic friendship,"Hey! I'm really new to reddit so plz offer advice or tell me if I'm doing something wrong. 

So basically I've had this friend since highschool and it took me 3 years to realize she is a shitty person. When I met her our friendship was super one sided, it was always me helping her with boy problems or something dumb. It then turned into bonding over school (we both did online for a few years in highschool) to dating boys who were best friends. I'm 19 now and I moved across the country to be with my boyfriend who I actually met through her. 

It all started when I began dating my boyfriend in 2017, he was my first kiss, so her and her boyfriend (let's call him josh) would make fun of me and talk shit about us. Saying we were too affectionate and that our relationship was fake because I was too young to actually love him. We found out that all her and josh would do was talk about us behind our backs. They used to say that we were weird and annoying but somehow would still hang out with us. I was too nice to stand up for myself. We had a few falling outs over the years. Most of which would be something along the lines of her getting mad at me for dumb shit and then blocking me on social media until she came back crying because she had no other friends. Every single person in my life hated her. I had a really close group of friends that would see how mean they would be to us and hated that I still felt bad for her. 

We eventually turned into distant friends, seeing each other lives over social media but not texting, I enjoyed this since I never had to actually tell her I didn't want her in my life anymore. Fast forward to now, after I moved to another state. Her boyfriends family lives in the same city as I do. So one day I get a random call from her saying that she's moving to my city, and she needs a place to stay. And of course, I say ""sure you can stay here for two weeks while my boyfriend is gone."" That was dumb. She told me when she was moving that her and Josh already had been offered full time jobs. So that made me less scared. But then they got here and I quickly realized she had lied to me. I was now allowing a toxic friend to live IN MY HOUSE RENT FREE. seriously I'm so fucking stupid. So after about two weeks of them living here and not working, my boyfriend hits up Josh and says ""hey man im coming home, when are you guys leaving."" Note: my bf had been gone a month visiting family in another country and missed me, he def wanted time alone with me. So anyway after this text they basically freak out on us, blame me for having to live with Josh's parents and start all this drama in my house. And my dumb ass apologized and tried not to argue with her over text. They finally got their shit out of my house and I blocked her on everything. 

Sorry for the long backstory but after all this drama I've been just really angry, I have to see her dumb bf every time I go to target (he works there) and I think about them constantly. Like paranoia that they will come back into my life. Im mad at myself for always wanting to help people and believing they would change. Now I honestly just want to watch them burn and I feel like a shitty person. Any advice on how to move on from this awful situation?",1
543,Feeling lost in life atm any advice greatly appreciated,"My mom has been an alcoholic since before I was born but has been in recovery since I turned 16. Six months ago my father and her husband passed away of a heart attack and she began drowning herself in alcohol. She has gotten more abusive and more abusive over time. She just kept putting me down, talking to me as if I were completely devoid of common sense or intelligence. Sometimes lecturing me in front of groups of people and talking to me real slow. She also often called anyone I dated names like ""slut"" and often told me I were one as well. 

Anyway about 4 months ago I started dating this wonderful woman who I adore and who does nothing but lift me up. My mother was drunk about a month into this relationship and confronted me about bringing her in our house saying ""I will not have a slut in my house understand me"" I got angry and snapped. I stood up to her. I just couldn't take it anymore. I told her that she isn't gonna tell me what to do or what not to do anymore and if she wants to stop me she is welcome to try but she isn't going to win this time. Eventually it got heated enough my hands were on her shoulders and I was raising my voice. She called the police and I was arrested for domestic violence and had to spend 2 weeks in jail.

Upon release I move back in with my mother and my girlfriend came over and witnessed my mother talking down to me yet again while also being drunk again. She told me to move in with her because she wont let me be abused. Fast forward it's been five months of dating and we are very happy. We want to get married at the end of the month. I have friends telling me it's too soon and it definitely does make me thing. This woman saved me tho and I feel so so grateful and in love with her. 

All that aside I went to visit my mother today because I have to keep things civil so I dont get in worse trouble when my hearing comes around. When I got there she was acting funny and I had a feeling something was wrong. I smelled her drink when she turned her back and it smelled strongly of alcohol. I had to hold back the urge to say ""why don't you get some help you f***ing drunk"" I felt so angry. Instead I left.

I don't know if I am making the right choices in life now that I am out of the toxic environment. I also don't have therapy because I lost my insurance when I moved out of my mothers. What are ya'lls take?",1

270,How do I end this with him?,"Beginning of the college semester I made the mistake of making a tinder profile and not only matches were adding me on my social media but also people I didn’t match with. A guy adds me on my snap I assume it was because of tinder so I added back we talked a little and we went out a couple times. After going out on like 2 dates he already thinks I’m his girlfriend, thinks it’s appropriate to say “I love you” and thinks he already knows “I’m the one”. I expressed to him how I felt about how fast things were moving and that we hadn’t even gone out enough for me to consider myself his girlfriend so all of these other things are coming too fast also. He guilt trips me, even thought he did stop sayin “I love you” I realized behind all that he was super clingy and a helicopter SO (not calling him my boyfriend). I had to adjust my snap maps to wheee everyone can see it but him because he’ll watch where I go and then ask about it like I was doing something wrong, the first few times he tried to lie about not checking snap maps but I knew and eventually he just admitted and would screen shot my location on the map and send it to me. I turn off my Instagram activity because if 100% of my focus isn’t on texting him back he gets butt hurt, this involves insta activity because more often than not he says “you can be on insta but you can’t message me back” (a lot of times before I would even receive the 2min notification after receiving a message). I also had to turn off my read receipts on regular messages because if I ever opened a message there or on snap and didn’t reply right away I’d get an earful, yet again he gets butt hurt. Through all of this when he will complain about these things he always guilt trips me saying like “am I not good enough?” Or “I saw you read this, f*** me I guess” and many more. Thinking about this, he’s already at the point where I would consider him a social media stalker, checking my activity on any account I could possibly have and complaining about it all the time. It is only a matter of time before he starts showing up outside my class I just finished or watching me walk around campus. He even found my main Reddit profile which I had not used for a good 3 months and just recently became active again and complained about what was on that when all of it was before I even knew he existed. If I block him I’ll have to stop going to the church and college student ministry group that goes along with that church because I will have to see him 2 times a week and if the group finds out I ended this by just blocking him they’ll never look at me the same again even thought I tried to break it off verbally once before they just wouldn’t know that. (Btw the people at the church think we’re this happy couple because he’s been at the church longer than me and told them what he believes about our relationship not what is true about it). I could get a contact order from the school but I’m not sure I should go that severe. When I tried verbally he was about to cry right in front of my face and typical him, he was guilt tripping again so I fell back into the hole. How should I go about handling this situation?",1
932,Should I quit and find a new job or stay at my current job,"Right now, I am a high school student and have a part time job at a McDonalds.

On the other hand, I've also heard several firsthand accounts of my coworkers asking for a bit of leniency with their schedule for the same reason, only to get shut down and yelled at by the GM for ""not having enough work ethic"", etc. Should I quit my job now or stay at this job until I get enough seniority that I would be able to make my schedule flexible?  Keep in mind I've worked here for awhile and this problem hasn't really changed. I'm also not opposed to working weekends sometimes, I'm just getting peeved that I can't get any break from working weekends/vacations, killing my school social life.",1

69,How do I keep myself entertained / motivated at job where I have little to do?,"I work a full time (40 hours a week) job as an administrative employee. I've reached a point where I've become too efficient with this position. Over the past 3 years I've slowly but determinedly taken away various duties from my co-workers (with my boss's permission) to the point that my employer is now required to either hire a part-time temp or allocate my duties between 5 - 8 employees each time I leave for a week or more.

My problem? I'm literally completing all of my duties between 9 am and 12 pm each day and some days I literally have nothing to do at all. This is a problem when my regular shifts are 8 am to 5 pm, five days a week. And it's a problem when we're about to hit our slow season which means I'll have even less to do. I am bored to tears each day and I've lost all motivation and joy for this job. I tried talking to my employer about it but he said all that would happen is I'd get demoted to part-time and he legitimately does not care if he's paying me to just sit here and do nothing.

I do have a long-term plan to find another job but that's not going to be fully achieved for another year. How do I keep myself entertained in the meantime? I have my own cubicle and, excluding noisy things, can do pretty much whatever I want. And what can I do to develop at least a small sense of motivation for this job?

TL; DR I am bored to tears in my current job and I have hours of free time. What are some ways I can keep myself entertained that aren't noisy? And how does one stay motivated at a job when there's minimal work to be done?",1
536,How to write a story in which the characters get caught up into drug distribution without seeming too much like a Breaking Bad proxy?,"Especially now with El Camino out.

The characters in the story would be making and dealing drugs, building their own empire as well as dealing with the consequences that follow suit. 

The two biggest differences from my story to BB, I feel like, is: 1) The characters would start out in the working-class welfare environments of their city and work their way up to being elite kingpins, and 2) Rather than focusing solely on methamphetamine, the characters would start off with prescription-based marijuana and work their way up the drug ladder.

I feel like ""distributing drugs and dealing with the good and bad of the drug industry"" was really coined by Breaking Bad, though. Obviously it's not the ONLY source with that kind of material, but I feel as if it left almost a legacy on that sort of storytelling.",1

My mother is a 50 years old who noone will employ since she's been without working almost 20 years. What should I do?

263,How to deal with know-it-alls,"There's this guy in my class.

UGH can't even think about him without getting annoyed.

Imagine a shy, teenage boy with headphones in, always sitting at his desk, not talking much and seeming uninterested at every conversation.

(He kinda looks like Shaggy from Scooby Doo but thats another story)

Now imagine you having fun with your friends at school during lunch and going to get your books. It's an IB classroom so most people speak English even if its not their first language. As you ask your friend to get your books, you make a tiny, incredibly irrelevant grammar mistake. And guess what, our man Shaggy takes off his headphones and mutters the correct phrase. You ask what he said (in case you heard it incorrectly) and yes, he confirms that he found it appropriate to correct your speaking despite this person literally not being part of the group or the conversation, he just happened to overhear your FATAL mistake of saying lie instead of lay :))

you might say my frustration is minor, but holy fuck. This guy never takes a break.

During a school project we had to stay at my place to make a film for a project. We were many, it was good, but he was there. First of all he barely participated and loved making himself seem superior in the fact that he was filming and editing. (during the obligatory beginner course for editing he was legit complaining it was too easy and he could do SO much better than that. Note the fact that this was a beginner course for high school students.) Well, we were at my house, I was showing around and telling my friend about the greenhouse and stuff, and he kept, multiple times, either interrupting or without anyone asking, pointing out I was trying to ""prove myself"" and some other stuff I can't remember, making comments about so much stuff and pulling straw men, making me seem so stupid for doing normal things. Like bro, talking about growing some cauliflower and informing my friend how potatoes grow is not. that. deep., I wasn't asserting any dominance or whatever he was trying to tell me. the point is he was being a lil bitch and had it not affected my grade then I would have whooped his ass there and then. (also, none of my friends ever called him out on this then but we all agree it was kinda shit considering I was doing them all a favor of using my house, esp cause none of them helped with cleaning after and kept messing stuff up there) 

The worst part is, despite him often correcting and nitpicking and pointing out flaws during group projects, he rarely comes with anything constructive or useful back, or rarely even participating. If something is wrong he never lets us know until we ask or complain. And during normal conversation? well. I sometimes wonder if he seriously has any hobbies at all except correction and seeming uninterested, even if I ask him what he likes to do (cause hey, I might be a ranting bitch but I'm also a caring bitch who knows how it is to have no friends) he just kinda shrugs and looks at his phone. Ive tried many times, y'all.

Question is, although it happens SO often, how do I let him know? Its rude, but its not hurting anyone, but he is also complaining why nobody likes him. Whats the best approach for me/my friends? Cause we are getting really fed up, and I genuinely don't want to be mad at people unless they have change to improve. And well, even if he doesn't, how do I deal so that he doesn't become such a draining person to be with?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR how do I let an annoying know-it-all know that he is being an annoying know-it-all and that he should stop?",1

The topics are awesome and they seem like good classes. But right before college started my girlfriend of two years broke up with me, and 3 days later sends me a text saying ""I kissed (best friends name)"". And it hurt a lot.

But every time I go to try it's just... Blocked by myself. It sucks. I have never been a stranger to the military. My father was coast guard and my uncle was a army. And I start to think about joining the military. I believe it would be a good turning point for me. I started to talk to my dad about it and how I'm not one for college and I think the military would be a better option. He stops what he's doing and looks at me and says ""you and I have a lot in common. When I graduated high school I thought college was what was best, and it may have been. But after a year I just didn't see a point to anything. I left college and went to the military."" and we continued to talk about what branch best suits me. But I just don't know guys. If I were to join the military how would I begin that transition from leaving college with the free tuition still being in play (so my parents don't have to pay it) and swiftly joining the military?

833,"Weird situation at work: finished the work much earlier than expected from me, and now I kind of need an advice.","disclamer: I am kind of embarrassed to ask an advice in such ""1st world problem"", as I grow up in 2nd world country and I am aware this is kind of dumb thing to ask for advice. But I would really appretiate it , if you have and advice.

Hello there,

I am currently working for a big company through a temporary work company. Meaning they ""loaned"" me to this company that I work now, for 3 months. I am curretly at my 7th week of my 12 week employment. My contract is for 3 months with option to extend if I do I good job. And here is the thing: 

I dont want to give much identifiable details but, they basicly give me ""bundle""s of work, and I do a software thing. And when I finish processing that bundle, they give me another bundle. Being kinda good at my job, and wanting to show myself as good worker, I worked hard. Last week, being at 6th week, I finished another bundle and asked for the next, and my ""chef"" who isnt the boss , but basicly he is the 3rd level (1-boss 2-manager 3-chef 4-me) told me ""oh, good job Horkos. You did a really good job, I will tell you what to do tomorrow, I dont have anything in mind at the moment"".

What I found out the next day was, they expected all the bundles to be finished in 12 weeks. I finished them all at 6 weeks and basicly there isnt anything left for me to do. My chef likes me and satisfied, so he doesnt say anyting to boss about job being done, and gives me like 1-2 hours worth of others works everyday to keep me busy. On my 8 hours work day. He know I am basicly sitting there acting like doing something for 6 hours. So I need advice on 2 things:

1) What to do professionally, really. I know it sounds dumb, but if I just stay like this doing 2 hours work a day and just ""acting like busy"" for 6 hours, I really dont think they will be really into prolonging my contract, even tho my chef is really happy with me. 

2) How do I pass the time? This sounds stupid I know but here is the pickle: It is actually a big company with over 200 workers, and all computers are connected to and working from the main server. My computer doesnt even have a local harddisk, it works directly from servers of he company, my internet also goes via company servers, and basicly everything I do is probably easly monitored. So using computer to pass time (which is normally ideal as I look like working) is not an option. And my phones charge is over in 2 hours of active use, and a bit risky to use it as I look ""slacking"" playing with phone.

&amp;#x200B;

I didnt really have this kind of problems before, I worked in undetermined contacts in small companies, meaning I didnt have to worry much about future, and when I was done, I could easly check internet, even play games on my ""personal"" laptop that was given to me. I moved to another city now and this is the first time I work in a such company.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks for your time,",1
910,I'm not sure if I'm mentally stable enough to be in a relationship. Help?,"My last relationship was horribly mentally abusive where he pushed me to constantly blaming myself for every single issue.

I ended up attempting suicide because of all of the things he would say on top of other struggles and trauma in my life.

I hear all the things he used to say to me but now it's me to myself. I get super stressed and anxious and depressed at and with myself.

So I called my dad today to catch up and just see how is he doing. We talked for a bit before he brought up schooling and he is not happy with how it is going. I'm behind on a lot of stuff but I still will be able to graduate at least. He started ranting about my mother and how shitty she is so I tried to steer the conversation to something else. Anyway I just got off the phone with him and he agreed to stop bringing up school then started ranting about it again so I told him politely to fuck off and contact me when he wants to have an adult conversation.

He gets mad when I interrupt him or hang up on him when he is drunk but when he does it then it is fine. I've literally had enough, he's saying he is going to talk to a judge about my mother. Which I'm prepared to go to court to if I need too, I have texts he sent me when he was drunk and what not.

Should I just remove him from my life? He's already threatened to right me out of his will multiple times and I'll be honest, I don't care. He even texted me how he is giving his house and sixty thousand to his brother, something I don't give a fuck about honestly.

# Background

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in a family who had been Los Angeles in a place where there had been a lot of gangs and we had to move to a new town because my mother didn't want me to grow in an environment where i could've been either shot, killed, arrested, or be in a gang. we left to Baldwin Park then Pomona. I was in a public school but i then had to move to a new school because i was bullied constantly and i fell in depression, then attempted suicide because of it. i then was diagnosed with ADHD and had to take pills. gladly don't need to take them anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I Then moved to a Catholic School 30 minutes away from home because it was close to my mom's workplace. it was first cool and everyone was nice but then it took the turn for the worst. Because he is a bitch is gonna say his name. David! Ever since i moved to the new school he has made my life **LIVING HELL!**

he calls me every single curse word and slur in the book! He even threatens me and tells me he would beat me up or he would kill me. he once got me in a fight and I got in trouble for it! I was almost suspended when i tried to explain my side of the story. he still treats me like shit and thankfully I'm in Summer Vacation and now I planned revenge but I don't know how it would work out.

# My Revenge Plan

&amp;#x200B;

Stage 1: I record everything he does and says

since we are allowed to have our phones during class (appropriately) in our last year of middle school i will be able to write down and record everything he says including to and about who.

Stage 2: I would plan to get him Suspended or worst, Expelled.

I would be the ultimate snitch to him and I will show the principal all of my evidence and all the recordings. then they would have to bring David in the office and they would also bring witnesses to tell the entire story.

Stage 3: Lose the opportunity to his first choice school

since he got suspended or expelled his grade of conduct (Behavior) will drop really low and may not have a chance into getting to his first choice school (my first choice also). if he does have a shot, i would go to the faculty staff and show them my evidence of why he has no fit in that school he applied to. then they would have to not invite him over there or any other Catholic Highschool other than Public School or the worsts Catholic Private schools in his area.

# The Catch

my mom just recently told me that i wouldn't be able to get to apply to my school because she said that we were moving as far as Riverside so i wouldn't be able to see or get the reaction. People would also call me a Snitch because of it, all i want is revenge for him or he might never learn his lesson.

Long story short, the guy was being insistent because he sent the catfisher $3,500 for nudes that he had never received. So it all started to make sense.

There wasn’t much I could do to find the person, but I called police to report it since there was money involved. There was nothing they could do either so I kinda just forgot about it.

I am a 20F and I recently got diagnosed with bipolar type 2. I was misdiagnosed with only having depression about a year ago and I was put on Venlafaxine but since it would help for a while and then be useless, the doctor would up my dosage every few months and eventually I was on (what he told me was) the highest dosage possible. I am in the process now of coming off of venlafaxine so that I can start a mood stabilizer. As I’ve been lowering my dosage I can tell a drastic difference in my mental health. I am extremely paranoid, anxious, having frequent mood swings, and I haven’t been sleeping. I was also diagnosed with PTSD, OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder), and generalized anxiety disorder. I am definitely experiencing symptoms of everything I have been diagnosed with but some new experiences have been occurring as well.

I have been having intrusive thoughts for the majority of my life (suddenly thinking violent or sexual thoughts, flashbacks, and flashback-like visions of things that have never actually occurred). But recently I have been paranoid to the point that I feel as though someone is watching me even if I know for certain I am completely home alone. I also have a fear at night that once I am in bed I cannot get out of bed until it is daytime.  Even if I keep my lights on. I literally feel as though if I look off the edge of my bed at night someone will be on my floor or there will be no floor existing at all anymore. I am also feeling the same way about once I shut a door I do not want to open it again because I fear someone will be outside my bedroom door or once I open the door there will be nothing in existence, there will only be darkness. I do understand that these are very irrational thoughts but I cannot let these thoughts go. Does anyone know if this is just paranoia and anxiety or if there is a name for this specific fear?

I also feel like I achieved nothing so far (I'm turning 19 btw), and my parents don't hide that they feel the same.

119,[16F] Can you fix my life?,"Here are my problems in an easy to read  format:


  • Uncontrollably Lazy: I thought that this was something I chose, it is not. I can’t seem to make myself do anything important. It effect all aspects of my life. I cry when I’m forced to clean or walk or anything boring.
   
  •  Forgetful and Spacey: I think I have ADD. I have a hard time memorizing new information and reading text.  Sometimes people speak to me and I zone out so bad that I ask questions they’ve already answered.  This causes anxiety.

  • Substance Abuse: it’s not what it sounds like, it’s technically not abuse. I’ve been alternating nootropics, herbal medication, and whatever I can get my hands on to try and make my mind better/ clearer.  I’d list them all but it’s not useful information.  Also used cough medicine because it helped my depression.  Caffeine pills everyday or else. None of them help me do anything they just keep my mood regulated and me semi-stimulated. 

  • Sobriety: I’ve been off all the drugs (besides coffee) and I’ve reverted to my extremely dead head. I can’t do anything and everyone is pissing me off. Sounds like withdrawal, right? It isn’t. I was like this before I started the drugs. This is just my brain unmedicated. Now that I am not on any medication my mood is irregular and people are having a hard time with me. I can’t hold up my end of conversation and I appear much more stupid. 

  • Failing School: My grades have been shitty ever since I’ve started high school. It’s really bad. I did drugs to pass the SATs and I did very well, which proves my ADD point. I can’t take anything seriously except my hobbies. 

  
What can I do? My life is falling apart. I have bad hygiene, I have bad grades, nothing is entertaining, and I can’t finish writing anything.  Help! I’ve seen me at my best, academically, socially, physically and mentally. I know I have it. I have an appointment with an Adhd specialist, but I’m terrified that he’ll say I don’t have it.

499,I was let go at my toxic job. What do I do if I have not receive any severance or COBRA?,"Almost 2 weeks ago, I was let go from my job after working there for 6 months. They believe my performance didn't reach to their standards (but I am relieved that I left because the company is very toxic and cause my depression and anxiety. I even experienced anxiety attacks such as shortness of breath and chest pain during work and no one was willing to help). When I made the announcement to my friends and family, they asked if I received any severance or information on COBRA. I told them no, an HR staff who escorted me out did not say a single word to me. In fact, my former boss and HR NEVER said anything to me other than ""I'm afraid we have to let you go"". I did some research and found I am qualified for COBRA because the company I worked for has over 1k employees. 


My sister in law told me that I should receive a physical mail from the company regarding this information, but it's been almost 2 weeks since I was let go and have not heard anything from them. What do I do? How do I proceed from this?

83,Is something wrong or am I incredibly lazy?,"I don’t know if somethings wrong with me mental health wise. I think that a part of it is because I’m incredibly lazy and don’t bother to fix anything (my parents echo this sentiment). I believe them because I don’t put my all into fixing my problems but I also feel like I’m incapable of putting my all into fixing them. So I must be lazy right?

But there’s a nagging feeling that somethings wrong with me. Maybe I’m spending too much time looking into mental health issues to fit my problems to a disorder so that I can basically say “it’s not my fault, it’s this.” 

I have a highly irregular sleep pattern. I haven’t been successful in fixing it in months. I just *can’t* which isn’t a good excuse for my dad. He thinks I should just go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. Which would work, and and I haven’t tried it and given it my all, so thus I am incredibly lazy. 

It’s the same with school work, I just *can’t* commit myself to study. I can’t focus, and I feel like I can’t control it. I don’t know if everyone’s like this, where they can’t study and are bored from it incredibly easy, and just can’t study. But I can’t focus for long periods of time and I don’t know how normal that is. 

The problem is that this behavior is trickling into other aspects of my life too, like showering and cleaning my room. It’s not that I don’t shower and it’s not that I don’t clean my room, it’s that it gets very close to terrible before I fix it. 

I don’t know if any of this is normal, which is the main issue here. If it’s normal, then I can stop worrying about mental health issues and actually figure how to fix everything. I’m just trying to ease my worries.",1

642,"I feel like I have lost some of my true friends, including one who knows a LOT about me.","At my high school there are a group of kids that I was a part of that went to my Junior High. Around Valentine’s Day, I fell away from the group after people I didn’t like joined the friend group (One guy is important for later). After I fell away, I met this wonderful girl. We hung out for the 3 months left of school we had, and then I manned up and asked if I could get her number. To my surprise, she said yes, and wrote it down on a piece of paper. And after that, it was summer break.

In 7th and 8th grade I had a YT channel that I still use that would constantly get me harassed. Then with the rise of Fortnite, this particular group of boys kept harassing me about my channel and Fortnite stats when no one was around to defend me, singling me out. I began to not like school increasingly every day.

This bites me in the ass at the beginning of summer. Knowing that some of my good friends in the friend group weren’t going to the same high school as me, it led me to develop mild depression and social anxiety. I just didn’t want to talk to anyone about it, even my parents because I know they will tell me to suck it up and deal with it. I would remember moments of being harassed, almost like flashbacks, and it kept me awake at night.

Then I remembered the girl. I texted her on one night, and we struck up a conversation. Over the nights we would talk. On nights when I was having flashbacks and depressing moments, I would say, “I having a moment,” and she would comfort me. She was raised in a world where people would call her rude names, and she would react in rage. She used what she had learned from her experience to comfort me and help me out over summer.

Then school rolls out on a silver platter. I walk into school thinking everything is wonderful. I sat and ate lunch with the girl, then we went out to find the rest of our friends. And to my surprise, most of the people I didn’t like in our friend group are at my high school, with the one kid I mentioned earlier standing up and talking to everyone acting like he was in charge. Over a month, the girl gradually starts to hang out with him, and I worry that I may lose her.

I have always hated the guy, he would debase on a daily basis, and would constantly try to prove I was wrong, he was right.

Recently I told the girl I had had feelings for her (some friends told me to do it and get it off of my shoulder), and she said that she only sees me as a classmate, and friend. This was devastating. After that she didn’t respond to any texts that I sent her, and she doesn’t really like to talk to me in person. How do I go about this in trying to talk to her about this?

TL;DR: I seem to be more and more distant from people I though were my friends, including my crush, and I don’t know what to do.

Sorry if this is a long rant, I needed a place to vent. Should I just give up on her and move on from the group? What should I do in this situation?",1
160,"Agreed to help friend’s mom, but now I feel taken advantage of","Alright, so the parents of a good friend of mine are moving across the country in a couple of months. The mom asked me if I could sell some of their old clothes that they don’t want to bring with them (I’ve been pretty successful at selling used clothes on a couple of apps). I agree, but tell her that I can do only 1-2 trash bags full of clothes since I’m pretty busy with school and work. 

I go to pick up the clothes from their house, and she gives me 4 trash bags full of stuff. I really did not know what to say. I told her I’d sort through the bags and pick out the stuff that I thought would sell well and give her back the rest to donate. I fill 1.5 trash bags with sell-able stuff and tell her I’ll drop off everything else whenever it’s convenient for her. She says ok, and that she has another 4 more trash bags for me to go through, and that she’ll have even more later. 

I’m realizing that what we had originally agreed to is more than I’d like to handle right now. I’m still able to do the 1.5 trash bags of sell-able clothes but it will be more difficult than expected bc of other things that have popped up in life. But I do not have the time to go through more trash bags and sell more clothes. I’m a little ticked bc she’s adding more than what we agreed on. Reddit, how should I approach this situation?",1

461,"i (20F) ex-housemates, and best friends, are completely ignoring me and now my entire friendship group won't talk to me.","hey, sorry for the long post but im struggling a lot and really need some advice. 

for almost two years i have been living with two of my close friends (both 20M) in a townhouse while at uni. halfway though living together, one of my housemates girlfriends moved in, which i was fine with - not my preference but we were all friends and i wanted him to be happy. anyway, about two months ago now, my bf, who used to be in our friendship group at uni and then moved states for work, decided to move back to where our uni was as he wasnt liking his work and thought that overall it would be best to be with his girlfriend (me!!!!) and his mates.

i asked my housemates if he could move in with us (for the last 4 months of our lease), and one of them said yes (lets call him M; he was excited at the idea of having another mate + paying less rent), but the one whose girlfriend moved in (lets call him C) was a hard no, and he told me that his girlfriend (she is B) would also be a no. with my boyfriend moving down, i looked at the options and thought it would be best to move in with him, as it would save us both rent as we would be staying at each others house every night anyway. 

i called a house meeting to tell them i was moving out, and i heard that the couple had made a bet on whether i would stay or go, so i got a little bit sad and at the little meeting i was pretty annoyed and blatantly said i was leaving and would find a replacement without much emotion. anyway, my boyfriend and i stayed at another friends house for the next week as he felt uncomfortable at mine, and when i went to return home for clothes, i saw that C and B had covered my face in every photo and rubbed my name of of the chalkboard. i was pretty hurt, but laughed it off. 

fast forward a few weeks later, i've moved out and apparently the couple said that im not allowed back in the house anymore, and C has unfriended me on all social media accounts (petty). there was some complications with the person who took my place, and in short, i ended up having to tell the real estate agent that i was leaving because i was no longer happy with C illegally subletting to B (not entirely false, as if C's girlfriend could move in i dont get why my boyfriend couldnt do the same, so i wasnt happy to be carrying the liability of B anymore) because i was copping a lot of heat from her

M (who was my best mate) was initially kind of annoyed at the whole situation, but mainly stayed out of it and me and him stayed good mates, but after telling the real estate agent about B, he has also completely stopped talking to me and now my entire friendship group doesnt include me in anything. i dont get invited out and no one talks to me, even the people who werent involved. 

i understand it wasnt right of me to tell on B, but the only thing that will happen is that they will get a notice for her to evict (in which case they will accept and she will just keep staying there illegally) or they will add her to the lease, theres no real problem. i am just really hurt about how they crossed my face out and the other stuff they did which i didnt mention. 

its making me really sad not having any friends, when i go to the library at uni i feel like everyone is talking about me (it's a small uni and gossip gets around), and stuff. i dont know, i just feel like i lost friends. what should i do? i know that i should be the stronger person and just initiate conversation, and just talk to them, but for some reason i seriously cannot bring myself to do it. 

tl;dr = my ex-housemates, who used to be my best-friends, have completely stopped talking to me and now none of my friendship group talks to me or invites me anywhere. ive been completely isolated",1
500,"In a sticky situation with a girl, what do I do now?","TL:DR Guy likes girl, girl likes/liked guy, still “friends”, can’t read her, need help

Hey everyone, this is basically another “I like this girl how do I get her” to put it simply. I (19M) am in a bit of a weird situation. First year in college, trying to meet new people, I met this girl on Tinder (I know). We started snapping and kinda clicked and she came over one night shortly after that and spent the night (roommate gone). Long story short you know what happened, nothing crazy we just started with movies then got to talking and one thing led to another and blah blah blah.

So next morning we part ways and we’re both really happy, we talk throughout the week sporadically as she doesn’t use snap a whole lot. Then about a week later she all the sudden seems different, I ask her about it and she says she doesn’t want a relationship rn but still wants to talk and be friends. I’m not too upset and brush it off honestly, like it’s fine.

We’ve kept talking a little bit tho the past few weeks and I’m starting to really like her. I wasn’t really attached when we first met up, but now sometimes I catch myself thinking ab her at random times and I’m starting to think I actually feel something for her. She FaceTimed me randomly with her friend and we just chatted and it like made my whole night.

So now idk what to do. Obv rn everything is cool with us as friends she likes talking to me and she’s super cool and everything is chill. I really just want to ask her out tho. I honestly have no idea whether she’s still interested in me at all or not but part of me really just wants to take a chance and the other doesn’t wanna fuck up us being good friends. We do have a lot of common interests so like we could find fun stuff to do I just dk if I should go for it. Thoughts? Thanks for reading.",1

I am interested in many things, from painting, dancing, acting, pottery, working with animals, etc.. and I get myself far enough to research nearby places that offer adult classes on those things or volunteering at animal shelters, but I can't ever get myself to actually take action. I always imagine myself doing one of those things and I get the motivation to do them but when it comes to actually getting ready to go out for them, I feel like it's a chore that I want to avoid - and I don't know why!

I've read somewhere on reddit that not being able to attain deep interest in things may be a result of your brain going through too many ""instant gratification"" which I think is my case. I've definitely been addicted to my phone. 

To make some changes, I deactivated my Instagram account. That was the biggest thing I spent my time on so although it's only been a week I feel good about not having it. I also stopped smoking week about a month ago, since I felt that I was smoking way too much. I think the next step is controlling the time I spend on youtube/reddit. I’m hoping that gradually it will help with my overall wellbeing.

In addition, what are some other things I can do to help with my lack of interest/focus/passion/whatever you call it so that I can start living a more interesting life? I work a 9-5 and I make alright money (about \~76k/yr). I always made excuses like I need to save up or I don’t make enough to spend money on hobbies but I think I need to learn to invest in my life more, so any advice even if it costs money is welcomed. Thanks.",1
492,I'm a young girl in need of adult advice,"I'm a 17 year old girl, currently working my butt off in my junior year, I also rack up about 28 hours a week at a shitty fast food job. my parents are constantly fighting over me and since I drive, one of them is always angry with me when I leave, which is currently my biggest stressor. I want to leave.

My bf wants me to move with him this summer when I turn 18. I am able to graduate early this year, and I wanted to apply to a college near him. I really trust him, hes helped me through a lot and I honestly cant imagine anything happening to separate us. Even if something does, God forbid, I will be okay and able to support myself on my own. The college has a great psych program, so I'd be fine either way. 

My friends dont believe I'm going to be able to do this. I'm willing to leave them if they're gonna push me down.

804,How can I help my dad cope with his weight loss after a stroke?,"**this is not a medical advice question**



A year and a half ago my father (52M)  suffered  a schemic Stroke and had a 2% survival chance - he survived !. We put it down to the amount of smoking he has done in his life and doctors agreed.  Days after leaving the hospital being smoke free and feeling pretty good we started noticing he would hide and come back smelling of cigarettes.. he would lie about it saying he was not smoking or something alone those likes until one day we caught him red handed and he gave in telling us he was smoking again.  We were very disheartened and upset with him and he promised to quit again but after failed attempts with patches, pills and sprays it was no use and he has now gone back up to a 40 pack per day while losing weight at a rapid degree.  He has noticed himself in the mirror and is now depressed at the thought that he is now dying due to the weight loss and it’s scary as the doctor he regularly sees has told him he is a healthy weight and not to be concerned (this is clearly not true, he is skin and bones) He wants to quit again and is scared to die, but I just don’t see it happening :(

447,I want to treat my grandmother in the last stage of dementia with magic mushrooms,"Before you all yell at me i've thought really hard about this. Ive been using psilocybin for years i'm well versed with the drug from personal use but im not a doctor, scientist, or anyone qualified to determine weather this would actually help in any way. Its a hunch yeah. A big one.

My grandmother has been in a nurses care only 10 months. 10 months ago she was living on her own happy and healthy. I have no idea how she declined so fast. It breaks my soul to see her like this. Shell stare at me and tell me shes dead, that she needs my help. Sometimes she gets so out of it she starts saying ""dark"" ""dark"" Which from what i gather between her words her vision becomes dark and she cant see. She becomes so out of it that she seems to be somewhere else completely. I dont know who any of you are or what you believe in and to be honest im not so sure myself.

But I see my grandma. I Feel her with me now more then ever in a weird way and i can feel her trying to tell me whats wrong but she just cant put it into the right words. I know theres no research. I know i might not work. At this point she's going nowhere in there. The food their feeding her does her no good and im going to take her into my own care.

If I treated her with magic mushrooms i would start her on an extreamly low dose of 100 miligrams. Id hope to get up to 350 400 with a slow progression giving ample time in between days to rest.

my hope it with a change in diet and medicine. I could slow her dementia down to its original decline, and let my grandmother pass happy and sane.

She thinks shes dead, she keeps saying she needs my help.

553,i feel like my friends don’t actually like me,"today we went out for my friends 16th birthday, it was me, my friend M and my friend L it was Ms birthday. 

It started out fine and happy. The first strange thing to as in the car and M and L were texting in their phones and not talking out loud which i thought was odd but didn’t think about it after. 

For the first couple minutes at the mall nobody really knew what to do so we wandered around and eventually we fell ‘into a groove’ like it felt normal 

halfway through M started to get quiet and didn’t talk and was on his phone a lot and asked what was wrong but he wouldn’t tell 

he asked if i really wanted to go home, i shrugged and said it was up to him if he wanted me to go home for not because i didn’t think he wanted to hang out anymore 
also when we left the mall he pulled L over to the side and whispered something in her ear

when it was time to go home he sent a post in out group hat saying ‘worst feelings in the world’ and it said being left out at your own birthday party 
i apologized once i got home because they dropped me off first and i didn’t think we were supposed to go to his house after 

so i went inside. after a couple minutes i opened snap map to see where my little brother was and saw she was at his house. i confronted him about it and he said i said i didn’t want to come so they dropped me off

i said i didn’t, i guess we misunderstood. 
i said if he wanted me too i could get my parents to drive me over there because it was only 15 minutes away 
he said that L would be leaving in a minute anyway because her mom thought she was there all day 
i was like okay cool. that was around 6:00

i just checked the snap map and she’s still there, as of 1 minute ago. 
i know it seems like i was stalking or something but it’s just i’m really really hurt by this and it feels like they’re lying to me because it just seems weird
it makes me feel like that was their plan from the start

651,Low-level sexual harassment at work - is this worth pursuing?,"Throwaway account since I name my employer on my regular account.

I'm male working for a well known global company.  We have a number of retail locations around the world, but my job is at one of our corporate locations.  Not directly at HQ, but at a call-center adjunct to the HQ, located in another state.  My own personal job is considered headquarters-level.

Last week we had a female executive level visitor come out to meet our team for the first time. She's new in her position, having come into our company through a merger when my company bought theirs.  Important to this story, not only is the exec female, she's also British.

As part of our visit she took us out to a social event at a local rooftop bar.

During that social event, after some alcohol had been consumed, she made a very public comment about my penis.

The situation:  about 15-20 of us (all female except for me) were standing in conversation in a group, when one coworker comes up and states, ""I took college courses in international relations, and intercultural communication, and I just have to ask you, as a British person:  What Is Spotted Dick?""

At this point it wasn't about me, even though the penis joke was obvious. I laughed with everybody else at the funny name. Exec decides to give the professional answer first, and describes the British dessert that carries that name (a pudding dish with raisins.)  All well and good.

Then she continues by saying, ""In British English we've never really used that word for its adult meaning. It's only the Americans who started using the word 'dick' to mean"" ... then she pauses, looks around the group, identifies me as the only male, points to my groin and says, ""That!""

Everybody laughed at the funny joke. But when I got home I started wondering to myself, what if the genders were reversed? What if it were a male exec, talking about some common object with ""tit"" or ""pussy"" in its name, and pointing at the relevant part of a woman's anatomy?  Wouldn't that be the next #MeToo story?

AITA by thinking, at least privately, that wasn't appropriate?",1

I'm still not rich.

So, off to round two. Rather than typing it all again, I'll just paste the the old post here. (I'd prefer for the transition into wealth to be as quick and seamless as possible. I can't spend all day on Reddit. I have to plan out my future spending habits):

""I'm tired of not being rich. I need money to buy more toys and vacations.
I figure the experts at r/shittyadvice are as qualified as any real financial consultant. Imagine how great it would be for all of us if your shitty advice bought me a yacht. I think we can all agree that this is what shitty advice is all about.
As an extra incentive for you guys, I'll give Reddit gold to the 1st person that makes me rich. I might even sport a trip to Disney World if I get rich enough.
I only have a few conditions:

It can't be anything illegal. It will be hard to enjoy all my money if I end up in jail.

I can't whore myself out or sell sperm. My wife already vetoed these ideas.

When I say 'rich' I mean actual wealth with real value. I don't mean anything like rich pastries or Zimbabwean dollars.

A bit later, another girl (her good friend, girl B) showed that she had feelings for me, and (having low self-esteem) I went with it and convinced myself that i liked her because it was rare for a girl to show me that attention, and we had a “thing” i guess for about a month, but deep down i still liked girl A. A mutual friend of the two girls told me that they both had feelings for me around the time I was with girl B, but I had already shown girl B signs that I liked her so I felt trapped and told this mutual friend that i liked girl B. A while after, girl A started dating someone so I cast her off as someone I should just forget about, and long story short I hooked up with another one of her good friends(drunk decision). Girl A is still with this guy, but recently Ive not been able to get her off my mind and I genuinely feel like she could be my soulmate, we share similar interests/both have goofy personalities/shes very caring, funny, and attractive to me.

430,How do I (44m) stop having irrational insecure thoughts about my girlfriend (36f)?,"There's some background information necessary to give this context. I'll try to be as brief as I can.

I've been with my girlfriend for ten years. The first nine years have been good. I let her do her thing and have a lot of space and she does the same for me. We hardly ever argue. Then at the beginning of this year she has some issues with her daughter. The issues themselves aren't important for this since they don't involve me. Her daughter ended up moving to her dad's and my girlfriend ended up going to a counseling session.

Apparently the counselor asked some questions that made her question her relationships with pretty much everyone. Three months ago she tells me she feels like she always suppresses her own feelings to appease others. She also tells me she's only been content with me and our relationship, and she really wants to be really happy and not just content.  Further, she complains that I never go with her anywhere anymore and I drink too much. She is correct about both things. She says these things need to change because she really wants to be happy in our relationship and not just content. The last thing she tells me is that she does love me, but she doesn't always feel in love with me. She says it comes and goes.

I would drink pretty heavily nearly every weekend while she would go do various things. I would join her on maybe 10 percent of the things she did. I'm a home body she isn't.

I did a 180. I don't drink unless we're drinking together anymore. And I now go with her to nearly everything she does (really the only exceptions are when she's spending time with her friends....which I want to give her space for). These changes don't bother me. As a matter of fact I enjoy spending time with her immensely. I was an idiot for going so long without doing so.

The last 3 months it's been an absolute roller coaster. We'll have a good week or so and then something crappy will happen to ruin it all. It's almost always a communication issue....we'll talk about our feelings and it'll just degrade into an argument. We'll talk it through over a day or two then have a good week or two. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

This brings us to now and my current dilemma. I question and read into absolutely everything no matter how miniscule. For instance I'll text her while we're both at work asking her if she wants me to join her for her bowling league (I go watch since I'm not in their league). She won't answer immediately. So now I'm thinking she doesn't want me to go so I message her again, 30 minutes later, saying ""you know what, it's okay, just go without me"" and it ended up starting an argument. Intellectually I know she's at work, and I also know about a dozen other reasons why it might take her a bit to answer, but my mind instead gets fixated on me somehow upsetting her and I can't stop myself from doing something that causes a fight.

We also went camping with a bunch of friends. She wasn't mean to me, but she wasn't affectionate. To the point where, after the first night, we barely even touched each other. All the other couples aren't hanging on each other, but they do hug and/or kiss every now and then. Multiple days of this caused me to just freak out and feel like she doesn't love me anymore. I told her how I was feeling and it destroyed the rest of the trip. The thing is, she just wasn't being affectionate. We met eyes several times and she'd toss a smile my way, and we spoke perfectly cordially many times, but I fixate on the negative.

My mind obsesses over every minor thing, analyzes it to death, and then finds a way to sabotage my relationship with it. How do I stop obsessing over the negative and listen to what I intellectually know is correct?",1

953,Weird girl behaviour,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d0xcue/weird\_girl\_behaviour/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d0xcue/weird_girl_behaviour/)

This was a previous post about this issue.

This is the ""sequel"".

There is a girl I like, we met \~2 months ago. Situation between us was very flirty (not my words, our common friend's words).I told her I am really into getting to know her and I like her. She planned a date, she cancelled. She rejected my offers for a date twice in a span of 2 weeks,she would always ask if I ended up going out that night after all, she would propose ideas to ""go out sometime/go see this movie sometime/go do this sometime"" but nothing serious. We would end up a couple of times with a group, not just us, so I moved on.

I decided I did not want to waste any more time to her. So I started paying attention to other ,more open to my interest, women. She texted me once to ask me something about a girl friend of hers which I might know (ofc I did not and I doubt any sane person would think I could ve known). She started liking posts and pictures I post on social media (not everything), I wouldn't even consider it important but it was at that period that she started to.

Weeks went by, I think 2 or 3 and she texted me again Last week on Saturday. She asked me how I ve been and what's new in my life in general and then she ""asked me out"" to go see the movie Joker on Sunday. She said If I couldn't make it I should tell her a weekday that suits me, so I kinda got the idea that it would be the 2 of us. I said Sunday works fine.

We went to the cinema, it was just us, after the movie I told her if she'd like to go for a drink since we have enough time before the last subway. She was pretty warm about it ""yeah I'd propose it too!"".\*At this point I should add that before her saying yeah for the drinks my conclusion was that she just wanted to see the movie and could not find company / her friends didn't want to, but after seeing she was up for a drink I thought that, maybe something changed?\* Drink went very well, we had stuff to speak and in my opinion + according to my experience there was some sort of more than friendly chemistry.

I walked her to her bus stop and we stopped and she hugged me \*I thought of it as a friendly/polite gesture so I didn't go for a move\* and said ""I really had a great time with you today, we should definately do that again!"" When I was back home she had already texted me if I made it. These last 2 signs didn't seem any friendly to me at all, no reason to do it in a hangout with a friend of either sexes. I answered her message tomorrow like not caring ""yeah"".

Days passed and I didn't bother to text her, on Thursday she texted me some random stuff about hte Joker critics, and said we should watch more movies, less commercial this time. I thought of it as a way for her to make me ask her out. Which I did. I asked her whats her plans for Friday, she said nothing, I proposed to go out for drinks and she said yeah, but lets talk about it on Friday again (coz of her work).

On Friday I texted her ""so what's the plan for today"" around 6pm and at 8pm she replied that she just finished work and she is really really tired, and on her own rescheduled for tomorrow ""can we please do it tomorrow?"" I was angry about it but acted cool saying ""yeah I'd rather you didn't fall sleeping in the meantime!"". Saturday came and she texted me around 6pm saying sorry but I had totally forgotten this but a friend of mine has birthday and we had planned a surprise birthday party for her so I have to be there tonight!. I left it at seen. I felt really disappointed.

So my question is, **WHAT IS GOING ON? IT'S BEEN 2 MONTHS AND I STILL CAN'T FIGURE HER OUT!**

It seems too much of a trouble for someone to plan to go out with someone they know is into them, just the two, for her to not care. Is she just into for attention? If she was just in it for attention wouldn't she avoid to go out with me just us? Wouldn't she just say no can't make it on friday than say yeah and then reschedule when Friday doesn't fit?  It honestly seems too much of an effort for someone to put just to get some attention or just to play. I understand that her last attitude about accepting, cancelling, rescheduling and cancelling again is disrespectful to me, I also understand it might have happened that she was really tired and had forgotten about the whole surprise party, but c'mon. Why would she bother to tell me stuff like ""I had such a great time with you tonight!"" And why would she text me again after our ""date"" if she didn't see me texting her.

Help me guys. Her hot-cold method is really making me stuck to her. I might go out with other girls and still have on my mind what's going on in hers.

Also, just for a clarification, I really think she is not very intellingent. Like she sais stuff that are stupid at times and like her asking me stuff there is no way I know because ""you might know"". I know the second one is just a tip to get a conversation started but you can come up with much better if you re average intellingence.",1
801,An ex friend wants to sue me,"Howdy y’all!

 So this guy I used to be friends with is getting his girlfriend to try to sue me for false accusation and harassment after I messaged her telling her her 21 year old boyfriend had cheated on her with a 15 year old girl and attempted to force said teenage girl to come to his house so he could get her drunk and “take her mind off things”. 

Now, after his girlfriend threatened to assault me after telling her what I found out, I blocked her. The boyfriend then starts making fake numbers threatening me and harassing me. I have screenshots of all of it. He has edited several old conversations from when we were friends and sent them to my boyfriend in an attempt to make me look like I’m threatening him, but I have all of the original messages.

Any advice?",1

But for some reason, some damn reason everyone including my close friends forget who i am and start judging me based on what they hear about me or misread my Instagram stories. It breaks my heart that they jump to conclusions so quickly when i know deep down in my heart I’ll never judge them like that.
Tonight i got accused of something I’d never do and I’m lost for words i have no tears left to cry.  I guess my question is how do i stop these things from getting to me???

878,Cleaning Rusted Metal?,"Okay, so. My family has a bit of a hobby of collecting old weapons, for the sole purpose of using them as decorations. For example, we have an old battle ax on the wall. It's dull and rusty and the handle is all dark and stained. My dad wants to get rid of it, but I really like that ax and I'd like to clean it up to convince him that it looks just fine and is worth keeping where it is. We have this metal cleaning/polishing stuff in the garage, that is normally used on things like metal rims on motorcycles and silverware. I'm pretty sure it'd be fine to use on the ax, but I just wanted to make sure that it'd be fine and wouldn't damage the metal or anything. I feel like I'm just being dumb but I really don't want to ruin the ax head. Thoughts?",1

423,"Unsanitary roommates, can't afford to move","Me and my boyfriend are renting a room in an attached guest home. We share it with one other roommate, a long time friend of ours, who has lived in this home for many years. His father owns the mortgage. His little sister lives in the main house (houses attached by shared garage). She boards and grooms dogs. My roommate is a construction foreman. 

Ok, so on to the unsanitary part. My roommate has been leaving his take out and fast food containers on his desk for many months. It's all in a big pile. I've never really seen him wash his hands or brush his teeth. He showers maybe once a week? Can't be sure. His sister and her wife and other roommate constantly wash things in the washer/dryer with dog poop on them. We constantly have to wipe poop and hair out of the washer before doing ours. Our front yard has a pile of garbage as big as a van sitting on it that's been collecting over the past half year. 

We aren't allowed to talk to his sister and her housemates. We have to go through our roommate, her brother. However, he went through some rough times recently. My boyfriend came into to the living room at one point to see him with a shotgun in his mouth. He is still with us, but I don't want to put pressure on him. At that point in time, he was throwing up every morning before work.

Lately, both me and my boyfriend have often felt nauseous. I've been sort of rundown and had a lot of health problems over the last couple years. It's hard to tell whether this is stress or not. My boyfriend is very very stressed right now and I've noticed him dry heaving this evening. 

I'm not sure if all this is stress related or partially something unhealthy in our home. Does anybody know if that's possible? And if so, any advice on how to address this? Everyone here is very trashy and doesn't seem to care, so I don't know what to do.",1

720,Almost crashed my Rear Wheel Drive Car,"Hello,

So I this story is a bit embarrassing. I am a new driver and I need some advice with how to be a better driver.

I was driving my car in the rain today (fresh rainfall) - and I have driven in the rain many times before as well as the snow and generally quite comfortable until today. I was turning onto a high-way and there was a turn (not really a turn, but the road curved) and as I was driving through the turn I guess I decided to accelerate. Thats when I lost control for about half a second. I pressed the break, which made it worse so then I let up on the break and pressed the accelerator a bit (which fixed the issue) I didn't hit anything, but that I think was just pure luck in terms of where the swerving occurred (lots of room to swerve)

Now I just learned today, my car is actually a rear wheel drive car. I always thought it was FWD. I've been driving almost every day now in Vancouver (lots of rain) for about 2 years and this is the first time it has actually become an issue.

So anyways, now I am scared shitless to turn and I am looking for some advice on how to:

A ) Be a more responsible / safe driver with a RWD car

B ) Get comfortable in my car again.",1
303,Getting back to work after 2+ year hiatus &amp; bad references,"I just got off a heavy prescription of benzos (3mg Alprazolam + 2mg Klonazapam per day) in March this year after being on them for the past 5 years (for general anxiety disorder). Slowly, but more and more, I'm feeling ""normal"" again and I'm in the middle of trying to get my life back together, but I'm not having luck with employment.

Some backstory-

A few years back I was let go from my job because I got into an argument with my boss regarding an award that was given to another employee based on work that I did myself. I was furious that someone else received credit for something I created and in my anger (and medicated state) said some stuff which got me terminated. During my exit-interview I threatened legal action if they continued using a different piece of software that I had created in my free time but was very helpful to their business.

About a year later I accepted a job offer with a different company. At this point in my life I was even more heavily medicated than I was a year prior and in a very bad place mentally. I didn't do anything to get myself fired, and I resigned without issue after only 3 months (because my first child had just been born, but mostly because I was unstable mentally), but, to put it simply, I wasn't a pleasant person to be around and I'm not going to get a good reference from them.

Those two jobs make up half of my job history for the past 10 years. After leaving the last job I started a business but in all honesty haven't done anything with it (although, on my resume, I say that I do ""general freelancing and contracting"" work for my business, is this a bad idea? I don't like to lie but I really need employment).

I'm applying for experienced, 80k+ positions, and recruiters are ghosting me after (very positive) initial meetings. This has happened 3 times now. They're third-party recruiters, not with the company itself, so they typically send people other potential job fits if the first one doesn't work out, or at least that's how I understood it after speaking with three different ones. I feel like they're calling my last two jobs and, best case, those jobs are refusing to say anything about my employment with them.

I'm a very hard worker, and with the exception of the last job I was at, people generally enjoy my presence. At the first job I spoke about I received the highest awards employees could get and was the only person (at the time) to have been promoted to my level as quickly as I was. But now I've dug myself into a ditch and I'm terrified I won't be able to land another job again. For the record, when I apply to positions I'm going in with the personalized cover letter and all. Like, I pride myself on the work I do. I hate that I put myself in this position.

Is there anything I can do going forward to help improve my image in the eyes of hiring managers, or do I have to suck it up and start with a company at the bottom again? Is there anything I'm currently doing wrong, or going about the wrong way?

864,My (F42) son (M19) has started walking around the house naked,"This only started recently. Since moving down to uni in early September, he has come home two weekends. 

The first time, I heard him coming downstairs to get something from the fridge so I went into the kitchen to chat with him. Obviously, I didn’t expect to see what I saw. I apologised and turned away but my son started chatting to me completely normally as though he were clothed. We ended up having a brief but pretty normal, albeit one-sided, conversation (I was too busy thinking “Don’t look down! Don’t look down!” to really contribute much beyond one word replies).

The second time, I literally bumped into him coming out of the bathroom. Again, he stopped me to tell me how beautiful I looked and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I know how that might sound weird or creepy considering the context but he has always done sweet little gentlemanly gestures like that. He would have done this even if he were clothed.

I just find it odd how nonchalant about it all he is. I mean, part of me feels like I should reprimand him for this but it seems innocent enough and he’s not a child anymore so I don’t want him to feel like I’m telling him off or anything. I don’t want him to feel self conscious around me either. I simply find this sudden onset of body confidence strange. Is it a phase?

Now I live in a big city with big dreams and amazing opportunities all around me. I have an amazing partner and so on. But... 

I have this assumption that people don't like me - I know it's in my head, but I don't know how to stop. It feels like everyone can see through me and that people still see me as weird, poor or damaged etc. I spend a lot of time trying to be ""normal"", so much that I don't know who I am anymore.

I submitted the best pic out of around  20-30 I took. I got a score of around 5.4/10 for attractiveness and just  over 6/10 for intelligence and trustworthiness. 5/10 is statistical  average on Photofeeler.

When I was  younger I was much worse looking and I always thought, ""If I could just  be average that would be enough. Then my personality might matter and I  could succeed."" I've had a couple surgeries since then with good  improvements though things could clearly still be better. I exercise,  eat healthy, and try to stay fit. I make top 1% income and I have no  kids, divorces, or major liabilities. I am naturally sociable and well  liked IRL.

According to  Photofeeler, it seems I have reached ""average,"" but it doesn't seem to  be enough. I still get zero matches on Tinder unless I boost. I did four  or five boosts last night consecutively and got 3 matches, two of which  replied once then no further. The third did not reply. Bumble is no  better. If I get a match, they don't message me. When I was on  POF/OKC/Match I would maybe get one reply for every 30 messages I would  send at best.

I thought I would  score worse on Photofeeler. I'm actually reasonably proud of my score.  I've worked hard for it. But I've still got nothing.

After I left I never spoke to them but I saw a screenshot of Mark suggesting they should ""jump"" me but never followed through with it or even said anything to me since then. Suzy and I start talking and we become friends and I tell her about how they are messed up and I'm not coming back. I expose something that Mark did. He showed me a picture of Suzy in a bra and panties so I told her that. She then tells the old group that Mark did this and mark explains himself by saying the picture was fake. They all started calling me a bunch of things and threw a bunch of insults at me for trying to break them up. I doubt the picture is fake but that's what he said to clear up his name but I don't even think that matters now. I don't think Suzy and I aren't friends anymore and they all have an even worse hatred toward me.

I understand I probably shouldn't have kept in contact with any of them but I do think she deserved to know and she was one of the people in the group who wouldn't put me down.

They probably won't ""jump"" me but I do think they will confront me. They could also ruin my reputation by making everyone think I tried to break them up.

I am a 29 year old male. I have been wondering about lingerie for both men and women.

Any advice?",1
876,Is this girl at work weird and should I ignore? U.K.,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",1
792,I think I'm being scammed on Tinder and I need help.,"I matched with someone on Tinder that asked what I was looking for and I said a relationship. 

She said that's okay, ask for my number and unmatched me. She then texted me and basically asked for sex saying she doesn't want me to get all clingy etc. I said that's fine. 

She then gave me a link to a website so she could ""verify"" if it's me and then give me her address. I clicked the link and it took to this thing where it said do you agree to these rules etc etc. **What's interesting is that the website must have known my IP** because it stated my city. 

It then took me to this website called OneNightFriend. I signed up and all by using a really old and unused email address. 

It's been 1.5 hours since she replied and now I'm getting worried that I've been scammed. The website took my postcode, but I was in the city so when I checked it it wasn't my postcode. I then changed it to some other city. 

I'm worried that s/he now has my postcode (probably doesn't), number, name and IP. 

**What should I do**? 

I've got an anxiety disorder and I'm kind of panicking right now.

254,"I like him, and I think he likes me?","Hi! So on Saturday I went to my first homecoming ever and it was pretty fun actually. I have an older sister at this high school and I'm friends with all of her friends as well. Throughout the night we all stayed in this big group. There is one boy in the group that I had thought was cute for a long time and he had never really acknowledged me before. This was his first homecoming so I wanted to make it great for him, because he is a senior and it would be his last one as well. Throughout the night we'd talk and laugh and dance near each other. At first I thought I was just seeing what I wanted to see, until my sisters friend (we'll call her Amy) came over and said ""Hey I think (the boy, we'll call him Danny) is checking you out."" So of course, I lost my shit. And I was blushing the whole time. I kept seeing him stare at me and smile out of the corner of my eye. So obviously I was catching feelings and I tried to pay no attention to that and that it'd just blow over. But it didn't. A song came on and everyone had a dance partner but me so I was just standing in my spot waiting for the song to end when Danny asked to dance with me. I began to dance with him, still losing my shit, and once the dance ended I walked away fast. I went to Amy, who was in the photo line, and started telling her all while I'm losing my shit. After I talk with Amy I go to my sister (We'll call her Jane) and tell her. Jane and Amy talk about it while I'm excited and can't stop blushing. More songs that all of our group know come on and we dance as hard as we can together in a large crowd. As the nights ending he asks me to dance with him two more times and I ask him once. My group started the conga line and at one point I meant to go up to Danny (the leader) and grab him to come back to my spot and our arms kind of locked and we just held them for a bit. Every photo we took after that Danny made sure I was next to him in all of them. We'd hug in each one and we would stand together for a couple seconds longer after the picture had been over with. I got his Snapchat and we've been talking ever since. Danny told Amy that he might like me but I'm nervous to mention it or bring it up. My last relationship really made me develop trust issues and commitment issues. I don't know how to go about this. Also sorry if there are any mistakes! It's 8:00am and I'm rushing this! I'd be grateful for any advice! Thank you!",1

483,Can't get a girlfriend...,"Can't get a girlfriend...

Alright, I know this post has been made a thousand+ times on multiple subreddits but it is truly a situation by situation basis. 

Anyways, if you're continuing to read I thank you for just hearing me out.

I'm attractive and I've been genuinely told that by other people I find very attractive. 

What I'm going to describe myself as may come across as cocky but I'm trying to be genuine about my situation and it's all true. 

*My Abilities/Talents*
---

* I workout a lot (4x-6x a week) (I got nice abs not a 6 pack but some good definition like a 4 pack, and the rest of my body is a nice lean muscular structure[I don't skip leg day haha])
* I'm tall (6'3"")
* Intelligent (I read and try to expand my knowledge a lot on a daily basis)
* Excellent Hygiene (Shower 2-3 Times a day, Brush my Teeth 3-5 times a day, cologne etc..)
* Great Fashion (Lots of Variety with plenty of colors and accessories)
* Really Good Hairstyle (Close Skin Fade with a Nice 1950s style swoosh)
* In the Military 
* From California (The Fun Part haha)
* Extremely Talented Musician 
1. I make really good instrumentals (I can make banging trap beats to full orchestras. I do everything from start to finish from lyrics/singing to mixing/mastering. I've been doing it for awhile with a no bullshit attitude as in I let people shit on my music without remorse until I got so good nobody could say negative shit. Even random strangers.)
* Extremely Sociable (I know how to turn it on easily. Comfortable on stages.)
* I talk to anyone and everyone
* Good Graphics Designer 
* Ambitious and Driven (I got really big goals and milestones but I have to go through each to get to the next.)
* Good Storyteller (I like writing, mainly Horror Movie Scripts/Novels, but I love history and scifi stuff too)

*Disclaimer*
---

I understand that this whole post may make me come across as entitled. However, I do respect boundaries and I don't think anyone directly deserves to be with me. I just wish somebody would be with me. It's starting to get extremely lonely I have all these friends but no one I can actually be intimate with you know. Then especially when they all have their boo and you have no one, I know you know how that makes you feel so that's why you see why I want to get out of this rut. There's really somedays where it doesn't seem like I should be alive. *The good thing is I never express this externally only subtly through music and that's why I go to the gym so much YAY!*. What's even better is I have no one to talk to about this cause it could jeopardize my job and security clearance over something small everyone goes through in life but feels extremely heavy on your heart YAY!

*My Predicament*
--- 

I can get really beautiful girls numbers and make them laugh and all that. But when I invite them to a date they usually just ghost me.

I have plenty of female friends but they just want to stay friends or they already have boyfriends. So I'm out of luck in that arena. 

*If I'm going to self-diagnose...*
---

I think it's because I don't know how to get truly intimate with a girl. But that's one of those experience / job paradoxes. (Where you only learn through doing) I could watch videos on YouTube but that won't be anywhere near as effective as just doing it. 

I'm not clingy but I hang onto one person in my mind for too long even after they've left. I don't externally show that at all just internally. I get over it eventually but it usually takes longer than normal I think. Cause I don't express that I've given them my heart but when I do they usually stab me in the back. So with that it usually takes me a little while after every failed attempt to get back into it. 

All my attractive female friends say they are really surprised I have not gotten a girlfriend yet.

When people try to guess my body count they expect I've banged dozens of chicks and dated a shit ton too. But then I tell them I've only done one girl and it was very awkward, and only dated 7 girls. 

I'm fine being with myself but at the same time it's like when will it end too you know",1

547,My (16F) friend (17M) is friends with my abuser (16-17ishM),"Last year, when I was 14, I met this guy (who I'll reffer to as X) one year older and hit it off immediately. We had a lot in common and eventually started dating in less than three months of having met him. 
We dated a long five months in which he started being very emotionally aggresive and abusive towards me within the first week. This has led me to have a lot of mental/self-esteem issues to this day (at 16 years old) where I can't talk about the relationship without feeling extremely anxious. 

During this time, my best friend (I'mma reffer to her as Renata) introduced me to this guy (Let's call him Miguel). He was (and is) a really nice guy and we immediately became friends. I supported him in every way and he supported me as well, and he quickly became one of my best buddies. 

Flashback to last friday, I was hanging out with Renata and Miguel, and somehow x was bought up in the conversation, and when this happened Renata faked a gag and audibly said ""Ew"". So, I am aware that Miguel and x go to the same class, and obviously have to talk to eachother. And Miguel is 100% aware I was in an abusive relationship with him, were he was the abuser. But then, Miguel started talking how of a good relationship they had and, while he admits he's a ""sicko"", he still considers him a friend. I didn't say anything. 

I feel really hurt on the inside, I'm not really sure why. I guess I feel betrayed? Or maybe just... Less of a friend. I know X is initially a really cool guy, I guess, but I just don't know. I'm really conflicted, and I've been feeling down since. 

I mean, I can't force him to not like him or stop being friends with X. He has every right to do so. But just imagining my best friend being friends with him makes me feel like my heart is being ripped off my chest. I really don't want to stop being friends with Miguel, I love him very much!

What do I do? 


TL;DR: My best friend is friends with my abusive ex, and he knows he was my abuser very well. I don't want to stop being her friend, but I don't know if I can handle this. What do I do?

EDIT: I think I'd better clear out immediatly I did not mean X mistreated me the first week and then everything went normally, I meant that after the first week of dating he started abusing me.",1

524,EMT going to Paramedic school needing a car! (plus debts),"   
Hey there!  


This is going to be a lot so please bear with me.  


I've been in EMS for a year and started with the fire department. This required a fire academy, uniforms, eye surgery, and other expenses. I managed to rack up around $10,000 in debt. After a couple months with the fire department I realized how unhappy I was with my life. The focus was solely on fire fighting when my intent was emergency medicine. I decided after two months that my mental health was more important and quit the fire department, packed a couple bags and moved to a new state where I had some friends willing to help me get back on my feet. Luck me landed a job working on an ambulance with an amazing group of people within 1 month. My partner I work with is an amazing medic and even provides me rides to and from work. Fast forward nearly a year and I am being offered to be paid through paramedic school, its just over a year long and requires 600 clinical hours not to mention the classroom time. Only downside is I have to work full time while doing it. Ill be getting roughly 2-3 days off a month which will be spent studying. This also requires me to go from my current partner on the night shift to a day shift. With the amount of driving I need it looks like I have to get a car and leasing won't be an option. Credit wise I have an average score but its new as of this year, I always avoided it before I realized how important it was.  


Now to the point... what are some ways for me to get money or a car while in this situation. I've been trying to pay most my debt off so I spent most my paychecks there rather than save. By the time I have money saved for a car I'll be in medic school. Currently I have no savings but starting every paycheck I'll be putting as much as I possibly can away while still paying minimums on my debt and rent / living expenses  


Thanks to anyone who stuck by and read all of this. I appreciate all of you. Be safe out there!",1

417,"this is going to be a long sad one, sorry in advance.","TL;DR: my crush/close friend marty and my best friend rose got together after i failed to tell either of them that i liked marty, rose being one of the most sought after girls in the school and marty being a short cute nerd i’d fallen for. after a long time of them being together they split up and i was “forbid” from speaking to him. we grew apart over the years but i saw him at a party a few days ago and we’ve been nonstop talking since. 

questions: is it wrong to want to date him now? am i allowed to be mad at my friend for telling me not to date him or even talk to him?

the longgggg story:

it was my 8th grade year in middle school, (i know, young). life was easy, the stress of high school and college wasn’t an issue, my friends were all in my classes, and i ate lunch at 10:30am. 

i’d never been exactly popular in school, being a little chubby and never really caring about my hair or makeup. i got along pretty well by being smart(ish) and being friends with a lot of guys. these guys never saw me as anything but another bro, but that didn’t bother me because i never felt like i wanted to be more than a bro. i came to their parties and talked about other girls they thought were hot. i didn’t think of myself as a lesbian though, i knew i was into guys, just never these guys.

i had other friends too though, like my one friend we’ll call rose. rose was beautiful. every guy i was friends with thought she was gorgeous, and not only that but she was funny too. witty, charming, perfect hair and body, music taste, loved good movies. she was everything a guy could want. and she was my best friend.

i was content with being the funny girl who’s friends with the hot chick for a while. then, i met him. we’ll call him marty mcfly (he loves those movies).

we got sat next to each other in science class. he excitedly introduced himself,

“Hey! I’m Marty, you’re friends with Ryan right?”

“yeah, that’s me!”

he didn’t mention anything about rose or how gorgeous she was. 

we had an instant connection. we talked about our favorite movies, books, shows, plays, MUSIC, and everything in between. we became best friends. the teachers would have to separate us in class and even then we would yell across the room at each other. it was a never ending fight to get just one more joke in or one more comment about the movie we watched last night. i was high on a cloud. we texted nonstop. we decided one day we were gonna write a book together.
that’s another thing, this kid is a genius with words. he brought me to tears in 3 pages of a short story he wrote because he was bored in class. he texted me poems he wrote and ideas he had for books. we planned to meet at the library in the future and write novels together, because he always loved my writing too. i began to get feelings for him, and not just the kind you get around your buddies either. the love kind.

i didn’t tell anybody.

one thing to know about marty is he was pretty short. a few inches shorter than me. because of this, i called him short stack.  he always knew it was a joke and even started calling himself that in his stories. i didn’t care how tall he was, to me he was the cutest thing alive. the smartest guy, the wittiest, the most amazing person i knew. 

i still didn’t tell anybody.

then, one day, my heart came to a screeching halt.

we were sitting in lunch, when suddenly rose leaned over to me:

“You know who’s kind cute?”

“who?” i said, shoving a peanut butter and jelly uncrustable into my mouth.

“Marty!”

i almost spit the damn sandwich onto the table. no. no. she did not say what i think she just said. marty was supposed to be mine. he was supposed to be the one she couldn’t touch, the one she couldn’t take. she had every guy wrapped around her finger, why him?

i almost cried right then, because i knew there was nothing i could do to stop her from getting him before i could.

i never even told her i liked him.

i simply shrugged, “yeah, he’s pretty cool!” 

“aren’t you friends with him?” rose asked.

“of course, i could give you his number,“ the words just came spilling out of me. i had no idea why, i didn’t want to say them in the first place, “i’m sure he’d love to talk to you!”

rose got excited. i told her all of his favorite things, his birthday, his mom’s favorite candy, everything i knew by heart. even told her how he was allergic to peanuts. i used my words to help her craft a perfect starting text. and almost every text after that.

and so began a 2 year long, painful battle.

they talked. he was hesitant because she was a little out of his confort zone and he seemed like he was avoiding upsetting me for some reason, but he of course fell for her personality and looks. he was obsessed with her. he started talking to me about her. 

marty, the guy i thought could one day be mine. the guy i thought would be out of the question for someone so desired after as rose, had been swept up from in front of me. i didn’t feel like i owned him, and i didn’t think she was “out of his league” or something, it was just like losing two best friends and trading them in for a constant bicker in my head saying “you were never good enough for him. she deserved him anyway. he deserved her.”

i couldn’t even be mad at rose, she had done nothing wrong.
i couldn’t be mad at marty, he was happy.
i was left stewing with the idea that rose was just always going to get what she wanted and i was going to be left alone.
and i accepted that.

fast forward, to freshman year in high school.
marty is going to a different high school in the area, and me and rose have been up and down in our friendship. we were on an up when her and marty’s relationship came crashing down. she texted me all about it. marty was tired of waiting, they’d been “talking” for about a year and he felt like she was leading him on. i agreed with him, but i never told her that. i just listened. she had been talking to other guys while her and marty were talking, and i let it all happen. i don’t know why. i didn’t feel as if it was my place to speak up.

since rose forbid me from hanging out with marty we’d grown apart. i still read his short stories occasionally and missed him a lot. i saw him at football games sometimes but he was always with rose. i felt hopeless. i’d had several boyfriends since marty, as i’d gotten taller, lost a ton of weight, started wearing makeup, got braces, and started taking care of my hair, but none of them made me feel as comfortable as he had. i felt better in my skin but i never exuded any confidence because of it. i still felt totally inferior to rose in every way, and almost let it control me. i compensated by becoming the “funny” friend, and that’s all people saw me as.

that same year, me, rose, and my best friend destiny went to one of marty’s soccer games after he cut off things with rose. i saw him for the first time in years. 
he was so, so, so, cute. just as i’d remembered him. he was taller, way taller, with large black curls that he had pulled back, tan skin and huge brown eyes. he was adorable. it took everything in me not to cry, thinking about how much i’d missed seeing him everyday.

all rose talked about was how he was missing out by not dating her. i didn’t listen anymore, i didn’t care. marty was playing soccer like he’d been born to do it, and i got lost watching him. the ball accidentally got kicked up near where we were sitting, i grabbed it and gave it my best softball serve back at the ump, will saw me and i saw him crack a smile. he was happy to see me. i waved, and he blew a kiss. i of course grabbed it out of the air and put it in my pocket. rose was fuming. she didn’t say anything but i saw her tweet something, so she obviously was upset. i didn’t care, i let her stew. 

after the game rose was too scared to approach him, so i happily ran up and gave him a hug.
“so nice to see you!” i practically yelled, “you look so great!”

“thanks, you too!” he replied, in this impossibly deep crackling voice that sounded like a definite transition phase.

we talked happily for a while until my ride was there. we said our goodbyes and i caught up with rose and destiny. marty texted me the entire way home and the rest of the night. that was the last time we talked for a long time.

flash forward 2 years later, to my junior year in high school.

i’ve dated a few more guys, none filling the void marty had left, but i got my braces off, and i’m looking for colleges to apply to.
i thought i’d be able to move on.

then, the party happened.

my ex-boyfriend, now one of my best friends named austin had a birthday party on october 12th of this year. it was his 17th birthday, and all he wanted was a small get together with his closest friends. so that’s what we had. he invited me, and 8 other people. i show up with my friend jasmine with presents in tow. we were the firsts to show up so we sat on the porch and breathed the autumn air with austin waiting to welcome the rest of the guests. then he informed me of the guest list.

“I invited Marty!” he said excitedly.

“marty?” i said, in a shaky voice. i haven’t seen him in two years, and all i can think about is why i decided to wear a navy blue shirt that says howdy on it to this stupid party.

austin picked up on the nervousness in my demeanor.

“whats wrong?” he asked.

i brushed it off like it was nothing and changed the subject. 
he quickly brought me back.

“alex, seriously, what’s bothering you?”

i started crying. i felt awful, it was his birthday party, but he just listened. i told him everything. he stopped me before i could completely finish.

“alex, i know you might not want to hear this but i think it will clear up a lot for you,” austin said in a concerning tone.

“go ahead and say it, i don’t care,” i sighed, obviously caring.

“marty liked you in middle school. he always did. he talked about how you shoved him away and pushed him toward rose.
marty never wanted to date rose. he wanted to date you, and the only reason he talked to rose was because you never gave him the chance to tell you how he felt.”

my heart leapt. i didn’t know what to do. i didn’t know if i was happy or sad, mad or excited, all i knew was i was angry at myself. why the fuck did i push him away? was it obvious he liked me? am i an idiot? all the questions started rushing to me when i was interrupted by the sound of another person pulling into a gravel driveway. 

the rest of the waiting became a guessing game of which car is marty’s, until he finally pulled in the driveway. stepping out of his car, it was like i was seeing an angel. his hair was twice as fluffy as it ever was and he was taller and more fit than i’d ever seen him. he radiated confidence. i was so happy for him. he saw me and cracked a huge smile.

“Hey alex!” he said, in a much more developed and clear deep voice this time.
“hey marty,” i said, trying not to sound way too excited.

we all walked inside and it was like electricity. we couldn’t stop talking and looking and admiring each other the entire party. we laughed, we high fived, he wore my scrunchie (oooo), it was electrifying. it was like our friendship hadn’t missed a beat. 

we were playing sardines, which is basically teenager hide and seek, and it started getting dark outside. i mentioned that i was kinda scared, and marty excitedly suggested the idea of partner hide and seek. he grabbed my hand and said “i call dibs on short stack!”

my heart raced. short stack. how the fuck did he remember that?

long story short, we left that party with a reignited passion for our friendship. i’ve texted him everyday since.

so has rose.
rose texted me the moment she found out marty was at the party. she told me if i tried to talk to him she’d cut me off. and i don’t know what to do.

i’m so torn, i’m so sad, and i want this love between me and marty to finally see some light of day. i want to tell him i’ve loved him for years. but i don’t know what to do. am i a dick if i go after marty? should i give up? does rose have the right to be mad if i told him i loved him?

i just can’t get the what if’s out of my head.

so please, redditors if anyone reads this, go after that guy. tell him he’s special. tell him what he means to you. and god, please don’t push him away. because he’ll go, not because he wants to, but because you told him to. 

if you’re unhappy in a relationship, break it off. nobody benefits when a relationship is one sided. it’s easier said than done, but i promise it’s worth the grief. 

if you’re lucky enough to have a happy relationship, tell your girlfriend or boyfriend they’re everything to you. hug them and kiss them and let them know you’re there. they’ll love it.

i hope one day marty will do the same for me.

edit: me and marty were texting as i wrote this, we’re grabbing pizza at a local pizza restaurant where one of our old classmates is playing a gig. i’m excited to catch up. now we just have to tell rose how i’m feeling...",1
302,My online friend is suffering and I can't do anything about it.,"This has been bothering me for days now and I don't know how I would be able to help. Since August, I decided to start playing Animal Crossing New Leaf again after leaving for a year. I made some great friends, but one person stood out from the rest. I probably shouldn't use her name so I'll call her Beth.

I started to use acnl as some sort of venting tool for things like stress from school because my friends there are very understanding. Beth ended up becoming my ""best friend"" of sorts sometime at the end of September. We helped eachother to cope with life, but the more I listened, the more I felt extremely guilty that I couldn't help HER out.

She had an abusive mother a long time ago and had to be taken out of her custody. She then got adopted by her new mother and father who aren't great either. They took away her phone, computer and 3ds, but she managed to steal her 3ds back which is how we can still talk. She has multiple medical problems like incontience (can't hold in waste for long), asthma (fairly common but worth mentioning) and mental health issues like the lack of stress tolerance. This greatly harmed her self esteem and made her vulndrable.

Multiple guys at her school asked for nude images of her and she was pressurised to accept. The word of this travelled around her school and made her extremely unpopular. Most people now call her a ""slut"" or a ""thot"", making her feel even more worthless.

All of this combined increases my extreme guilt that I am unable to help her out in any way and have an extremely unreliable way of talking to her as she does not have a phone. I'm even younger than her and my parents don't even know that I got Reddit or have online friends at all. I feel powerless and I worry about her daily. She made me feel like my life was actually worth living. Please help me Reddit, I need advice.

Edit: Ok, I have an important update. She's going to move out of her home when she's 18 to a friend's house. So maybe life isn't going to be shit for her after all. Idk how she'll last for the next few years though.",1

I text my female friends the whole day and I mean like 10 minutes answers and just talk and talk and make plans to meet once a week but and it comes the the ge you are dating the more I ignored her the more she is Invested in you itd amazing how weird it is.
I've been talking for this girl(19) for almost 2 months and we used to text all day, she started answering once a day so I decided to just not pay attention to her anymore and guess what, she started drunk calling me, tagging me in pictures in Instagram trying to get my attention and since I started texting her just to hang she is all over me, calling me, telling how much of a connection we have. It's so funny how it is because when I was texting her every day she lost interest and even mention once than she wasn't feeling the same as before.

For a bit of background, when I was younger I was terrified of injections and always cried and screamed when I had one done. Having not had any shots for a couple years I kind of pushed it to the back of my mind assuming I had all my vaccines and when she came over with the shots I started having a panic attack, I was crying and had trouble breathing for a minute or two after. 

She also told me that I'm going to need to get a blood test so they can see exactly which vaccines I have received (there was a bit of a mix-up because I changed doctors a lot) and she has to take blood from that elbow vein (don't know what its called).

973,Is he interested or just using me?,"Posting this again cuz no one answered my question but rather commented on the age gap 😑

I'm 18, he's 29 soon 30. I look like I'm 14 though and thats important to keep in mind because it technically means he is attracted to someone looking like 14-15. I am though very mature for my age, been through stuff in my life and I'm quite the hard working person with straight As.

Anyways, we've been seeing each other for 2 months now. Just ""seeing"" each other so I don't rly know what we are. We've tried having sex once but I stopped him and he was very nice about it, because I just wasnt ready. He does however sexually touch me all the time but nothing goes down because I don't allow it and he respects that.

Anyways, when I told him that my friend in school asked me out on a date, he told me smthg along the lines of ""I thought we were seeing each other... but I guess you do you. I want to see you more tho"".

Either he's really interested and wants a relationship later or he's being selfish and doesnt want me to go out with other guys because he's waiting for the sex and wants to have me for himself (yeah I know I'm looking very deep into it😂).

Do you guys think he's interested or just using me?

Personally, I like him, he is very nice, he is fun to be around, he is very clean which is super attractive in a guy, and he is caring. Also I love his touch ;). I slept over at his place once, we slept next to each other, he touched me but nothing went down :). Only thing he ""lacks"" is he's not funny and i like funny guys, and he is rly big compared to me (Im very petite). But no one's perfect, i got my flaws too.",1
586,Friendship dilemma,"So for just over three months now I have been in a relationship with someone I cared deeply for, and that has not changed. The issue however is I have a small friend group and she had a small friend group, we merged for a while then as groups we didn’t hang out as much, we broke off for a while but it was all fine, before my relationship started I had been single for about two and a half years and I had really liked the one particular person. After my birthday party (which I had not wanted to have, my 16th, not very relative) but a few days after that I got into a relationship and it had all been going great and as time went on we hung out a lot, with her and my small friend group but fast forward a couple months, and my friend group had said that I had grown more distant from them (which had been sort of true) and that they would be happy for me as long as I was happy and I thought that was great said thanks said we should hang out sometime. We hadn’t talked for a while then late one night I was hanging out with my girlfriend and they texted me asking to hangout, I said I would like to but I can’t (the reason for not being able to go didn’t actually relate to my girlfriend as she thought I should go) the reason why I couldn’t go is because we recently started a family business and I am not allowed to go out late as I have work the next morning, my girlfriend is allowed to come over but she leaves at a certain time due to the same fact. However my friends had known I was hanging with her and when I couldn’t go I think they took it as me blowing them off for her as up to the present day they do not talk to me. No hellos in the hall, not a nod of acknowledgement, not even a look in my direction. On my way to my locker (I’m in high school if can not tell at this point) I pass a extension to the friend group who I had been very close with when I was younger and now they don’t say hi to me either. So currently my friend group is pretty much my girlfriend, her group, and a guy I play video games with (who I see regularly) 

The main issue I have though is I’m afraid of for some reason my relationship doesn’t work out then I’ll be quite friendless as I wouldn’t be talking with her, her friends would be on her side, and my friends don’t talk to me",1

497,I’m consciously letting everyone who cares about me down and I can’t stop doing it.,"I’m an 18 y/o male from the U.S. and recently moved to another country for university. At the time I thought that it was what I wanted but now that I’ve been here for a month and a half, I’m less motivated to do basically anything, than ever.

My first month away has been hard because I’m very bad at making friends (I’ve made no real friends) and stay in my dorm all the time. I feel like at this point I blew my chance to meet people because everyone has settled into friend groups and I’m the odd man out. At home I had only a few friends, but they had been my friends since I was 6 and don’t really know how to make new friends.

I had my first midterm exam today. I didn’t study, I even got caught with my phone out during the exam, which is something I never would have done in high school. It resulted in my exam being confiscated and a meeting to be planned with my advisors, yet I don’t feel like I care very much.

At home, I used to smoke weed on the weekends with my friends but it never got to a point where it got in the way of my life and all the other stuff I have to do and it was fun to hang out with friends and just relax. But here, I’m alone and I have picked up the habit of smoking way too much and I’m scared it’s becoming an addiction. I feel isolated and like I have nothing to do here but smoke and watch hockey all day.

I haven’t even looked at my textbooks in the half semester Ive had them, I don’t eat very much, skip classes, and have even begun avoiding my girlfriend who’s the only person I get out to see.

My family doesn’t have much money so when I say that they have willingly contributed thousands of dollars to getting me in the position I’m in now and I can’t even work up enough motivation to study for my own midterm exams, it stings. I’m sure I’m letting them down and I’m not trying to be selfish but I really want to end it. I’ve never had this kind of isolation before and I don’t know what to do with myself. 

I know it’s only the start of my university career (maybe) but I feel like such a pile of shit and feel guilty for getting everyone’s expectations up and having them spend money that they saved months to get, just for me to throw it down the drain. I feel like they’d be better off without me. 

I’m starting to hate myself and constantly feel guilty for betraying the family who gave up so much for me.

893,Should I ask my girlfriend’s brother for his blessing?,"*Note* I am the girlfriend posting on behalf of my boyfriend, however I will be writing from my perspective. 

We are getting to the point of being engaged and have been discussing that lately. I am a little old fashioned in that I want my boyfriend to ask my dad’s blessing. (Not permission- I don’t need or want that.) I was talking to my younger brother on the phone the other day and mentioned that my boyfriend and I are rather serious, implying moving towards engagement, and my brother said when he gets to the point of asking my dad, my brother wants to be asked too. I told him that that is an unfair thing to ask, and he shouldn’t expect that, asking my dad is stressful enough. He said that he thinks he is a pretty chill guy (which to give him credit, he is), and it won’t be bad. 

I mentioned that my brother said this to me to my boyfriend. Boyfriend does not want to ask my brother. He thinks it is silly since my brother is younger than me(5 years difference). I told him it is definitely by no means required, but considering that he does not know my family well, it would give him major brownie points with that brother, which I think it would. I am not sure if my brother is serious or not, it could have been a joke. 

Overall, my boyfriend needs to ask my dad due to my family beliefs, that is not even a question. However, on thinking about it, due to getting into a pretty big fight with my dad in April, honestly I do not care too much about my dad’s opinion for the present. (It was a rather big fight and my dad insulted me and said things to others that I can’t let go.) I honestly care more for my moms and youngest brother’s opinions. So I think I am leaning towards wanting him to. 

The only weird part will be that I have another younger brother I don’t get along with. Him and my mom will feel left out of my boyfriend asks my youngest brother and my dad but not them.

I rarely used to go out of my house and have had very less friends. After I met my boyfriend, I started realizing how immature I was because there were so many things that I used to do things that were very kiddish and used to annoy him. Even though I've changed a lot, there are still so many things that haven't changed. For example,he says that my mannerisms are like that of a kid, like the way I talk. Even for small interesting things I get excited and I like to describe and express my emotions about the things that I like, be it scenery or food etc. I talk a lot . I'm not able to handle situations properly nor able to make decisions instantly and be confident about the decisions that I make. Basically I have low self confidence.My boyfriend gets really annoyed when I behave like this and he himself is going through a rough patch so I really want to be more mature and make him feel good so that he can depend on me.

Thing is maybe this is because of the environment I was brought up in  and I don't know how to fix it and any advice would be helpful.",1
73,How to stop thinking about her? (Ex girlfriend),"I can’t stop thinking about her recently. All the positive emotions she made me feel. How I did nothing but be toxic, and was too insecure to change myself. She was the perfect girl. It’s been 9 months and I still fucking think about her, and I keep trying to find out how to not think of her as “the one”, but it seems like there’s no way. It seems like I’ll always regret not being a better boyfriend for her. I get that I’m only 19 but I know she was the one for me. I know what love is and we were definitely in love. I just wish it didn’t have to end. I wish that I had been a better person and that I had my shit together.

How do I stop thinking about her?",1

584,"Just lost my job, on universal credit, depressed, anxious and been told my hearing impairment will get worse before it gets better, what should I do?","Hi, so I’ve recently lost my job and had to go back on universal credit. So for all those who don’t know what universal credit is, it’s basically job seekers allowance but worse. I usually apply for around 5-16 jobs a day, go to a few interviews and that, my work coach is always incredibly happy to see me and has openly said he wishes his other clients were the way I am about looking for a job, that has all been fine up to now and he’s extremely friendly. I unfortunately have a hearing impairment but cannot tell you what it is as nobody seems to be able to figure it out. Half of my life is spent with doctors and specialists. Finally, after four years of having this impairment (which has got progressively worse) , they might be able to do something. However, this will involve trying a few options and I have been warned at my last consultation that my hearing may get worse before it gets better during the process, I also, depending on whether the first option works, may need recovery time. This is obviously great that there may be something they can do, however, some days I can’t hear anything as it is, so worse means not hearing anything for quite a while, and while I have learned to cope ( I can lip read, my other senses have heightened as well which helps with some things) this does not help me in group situations, at interviews sometimes, on the phone, or any time a person is trying to talk to me while facing the other way. Basically, it’s going to impact my commitments (for universal credit) massively. My family think I should apply for PIP and/or switch to ESA. However, I’m not sure if it’s going to be an issue that there’s no definitive condition, just that I am hearing impaired as proved by the abundance of hearing tests I’ve had and their results, and my history of referrals, appointments, tests, etc. Not to mention the fact that although my work coach is aware of the issue I never officially registered it because I’ve been in quite a bit of denial and deeply resented and avoided calling myself disabled in any way shape or form. It’s only recently I can sort of accept it without crying, breaking down, or shutting myself off, and I still do sometimes. 

Basically, I’m just now accepting that I am technically disabled and that it DOES affect my life quite a lot no matter how much I don’t want it to. I had therapy for a small time because of my absolute mess of emotions about my life in general and this issue, which gave me a little push but I’ve only just now accepted it somewhat. I now need to figure out a way to tell the appropriate people that, yes I said I was fine, but no I am not fine no matter how much I would like to be a completely functional person, and hey that’s going to mess up my job searching while we try and fix it. Ugh what the hell am I gonna do? Where do I even start? X",1

917,I want to find my friend.,"3 years ago, I met this girl. She was awesome. We hung out a lot. She had a tough life (shit I won't get into) but we stuck together and it was amazing. She moved away, and I missed her a lot, but I texted her frequently and we chatted and shit. But as time went by, the texts became less frequent, until we never really spoke anymore. 

Fast forward a year ago. I moved back to my home country, and decided to get Instagram, and Lo and behold: her contact comes up. I immediately followed her, and for what seemed like an eternity, she finally accepted my request. 

We chatted. I had to jog her memory about who I was, but she remembered and it was nice. She told me she was in a sort of girls home for troubled children, as she was caught smoking and drinking. After that conversation, things faded and I didn't talk to her again.

Fast forward now. I was reminded of her through a game, actually. Life Is Strange. She acts and looks like Chloe in the game. Playing that game made me feel like I was hanging out with her again. The mannerisms she had, way she talked, etc. I cried at some parts, I miss her so much.

So I tried going back on her Instagram, it's like a ghost town...no activity, nothing. Emailed her, even reinstalled Kik to contact her. Nothing. 

I want to find her. I miss her a lot. I want to know if she's okay, how she's doing. 

So...I guess my question is...what are some methods I can use to find her?

Long story short, one of my friends showed me a conversation they'd had today and I got really weirded out. It was her and another close friend exchanging a bunch of messages about eating me. I know what you're thinking, they were probably joking, but that's what's getting to me, they seemed completely serious. They were wondering all sorts of weird stuff like what kind of food I would go well with and what sort of sound it would make as they devoured my flesh. I'm super confused right now, I don't want to talk about it with anyone in case they laugh at me but at the same time I feel really uncomfortable around them knowing they've had in-depth discussions about what I would taste like.

This store has been through several GMs (about 8) since I’ve been here. All of them have quit. Even the ones that have been with this company for years have left because of this store. Just as of today, the current (or now former I guess) GM quit after only 3 months (which seems to be average at this store) and so did another higher up employee. My GM called me and told me she couldn’t do it anymore and was leaving for another company where she would be a GM. She offered me a job with a significant pay raise, benefits, paid leave, etc etc. the only problem is this company is going down hill fast and I don’t expect it to be around long. As much as I dislike how hard I have to work at this store because of the staff shortage and drama here, I don’t think I’ll like anywhere else because I have a passion for pizza and any other fast food would probably not work well with me. This is the only job I’ve had that I actually liked. Earlier today one of the higher ups called me and told me the news which i told him I already knew and I was given a small raise, not even close to what I would get if I moved to the other company. 

I guess what I’m getting at is, I don’t want to chance changing jobs, hating it, and leaving. Even if I have to work hard here, I still get to do what I love, pizza.",1

442,Advice for blocking a phone number,"summary: my grandma has dementia and so does her sister (my great aunt) who lives in another state. my great aunt constantly calls my grandma and causes her anxiety due to them constantly arguing because they can never remember what they’ve talked about. my mom and grandpa want to block my great aunt’s phone number but have a few questions. 

1. will my grandma still be able to call my great aunt if that number is blocked on her phone? 

2. will my grandma get notifications if a blocked number calls her?

3. what will happen if my great aunt tries to call my grandma and her number is blocked?

some preemptive notes: them having limited/monitored contact is best for both of them. dementia and alzheimer’s are different, dementia is a personality change with someone going into fits of anger and rage due to their memory loss while alzheimer’s is mostly just the memory loss with little personality change. due to this my grandma and great aunt are very volatile and this whole situation needs to be handled very cautiously. my mom, my grandpa, and i can’t just go into this and not think about consequences.

Earlier this summer, me and a co-worker started a (short-lived) secret relation, which ultimately collapsed because she was cheating on her partner with me. She's since told the partner (they have something akin to an open relationship...but with certain rules) and they continue together.   


I've moved on (or at least thought I had), I'm heading to a new job with much better career prospects in the new year and many of my colleagues are moving on and heading to pastures new also. This Saturday just gone, me and her attended the leaving party for a mutual work friend. 

At the party, things were amicable and occasionally flirty (alcohol was involved) but there was no physical contact. Following the party, we WhatsApp eachother and she informs me that she's sorry things are the way they are, and that she still likes me. 

In my drunken mindset, I once again (having learned nothing from before clearly), open up and admit feelings still for her. Today, I'm regretting that because I feel it has taken me back to a place I thought I had moved on from.

767,I’m [25M] nervous about my options to remain with my GF [24F] due to our respective citizenships,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half, official for over a year. I live in Ireland and she lives in the US, and we met when she was studying abroad at my university in Ireland. We are passionately in love, and her being in my life in the long-term is my future. We were long distance for around 6 months towards the beginning, but have since been “living together” here at my flat for the past 5 months. She’s currently under a tourist visa, so she is not legally living with me - this is an important distinction to make as most European visas have an option for long term partners that have evidence of living together for a period of time. Our problem is now that we are actually planning our futures, the logistics of one of us immigrating to the other’s country is extremely complicated and seemingly impossible. The only two foreseeable options is to go long-distance or getting married earlier than we would anticipate. 

Now I love this girl, and there is no doubt in my mind that she is the one for me. But, with that said, I don’t want to risk anything in our relationship by rushing things too fast. It’s not that I do not want to marry her, but I don’t want to put anything at risk in our relationship by getting married too early. 

On the other hand, I really do not want to go long-distance for obvious reasons. This is a time in my life, and same with hers, where her support is so vital to me. Having her with me physically is extremely important to me, and we are a team now. It’s not that long-distance would cause us to break up, but I would like to avoid it as much as possible. 

We both are extremely nervous about this situation and we aren’t sure what to do. She mentioned going to therapy, not sure if she meant with me or not, but that would be an option. 

I guess my question is, are my concerns about getting married too quickly vs. long distance valid? And also if anyone has any advice, I’d love to hear from you all.",1

I recently started talking to a guy that I play games with.

He claims he can taste his saliva changing after a long gaming session. 

  

I have nothing against the guy but after some googles I became slightly sceptical of his claims. I also mentioned he should see a doctor, on which he replied that they won't listen and won't believe him. He also mentions that he doesn't open his window therefore it might be monoxide.

756,30 year old male in the USA. I am lost. Help?,"I'm 30 and feel like I'm reaching the end of the road. The main problem I'm seeking advice for here is employment. But if you can provide advice on the other problems listed, please do so.

I have a teaching degree and I hate teaching/schools/education system. But I hate all jobs. I hate the idea of working. If I had good health, at least I might have a bit more energy to endure it all. But with my bad health I just want to throw in the towel, especially at my age where I've made a ton of mistakes, have no money, no resources, no family or friends, no support system, back problems, stomach problems, no peace of mind, no stable record of employment/references, not well physically, mentally, or spiritually.

I don't like my life, myself, my genetics, I don't like other people, and I don't like this society. I am not fit for this world. The main thing I want is freedom, which I can only attain via economic freedom. Then I just want to live alone for the rest of my rotten life, with secure shelter and food. I will never reach self-actualization, and that's OK. All I want is some fucking peace. I've been lost all my life. I'm still lost at 30 and I feel I'm going no where. I have an idea of where I want to go, but that would take hard work, time, sacrifice - things which cause pain to me. I'm running out of will, energy, or desire to continue. I would rather die than work at jobs that make me miserable - which has been every job I've had. 

I feel constrained and confined in jobs, it's suffocating. The more people I have to deal with, the worst it is. Dealing and being around people gives me anxiety and desperation - I just want to get away and go home. But even in jobs where I don't have to deal with many people, I have to inevitably deal with other bullshit, so I feel like a slave and I want to run away. I feel I have no freedom in jobs, no flexibility, I hate having deadlines, pressure, and pretending to be thankful for having having a fucking job, walking on eggshells because I am expendable and they can easily get a replacement that will do twice as much for half the pay, and pretending to be nice and that I like others. I can't be myself. No, I don't like this fucking job. No, I don't want to be here. No, I don't like you. No, I don't want to go above and beyond. Yes, I have bad work ethic, I just want to do bare minimum, and go home and forget that I have to be here the next day. Every fucking job wants too much for too little. I don't buy the bullshit narratives of this world, related to this post - the following: ""Pull yourself by your bootstraps,"" ""the customer is always right,"" ""be thankful,"" ""provide value,"" ""work hard,"" ""go above and beyond,"" ""serve others,"" etc. It would be fantastic, in a way, if I was programmed like most others with ""Microsoft Slave"" which would allow me to be content and grateful for having a shit job (most jobs), and not see work as slavery/subjugation and gleefully and naively earn my little pennies until my death. 

Listen, in theory, I wish I was strong and resilient to endure. But I'm just a sad, weak, unhealthy, pathetic little man that is 24/7 in discomfort and pain (mainly due to back, stomach problems, and obviously mental tempest). As much as I'd like to endure (sounds good in theory), when applied in reality I always revert back to the truth - which is that I can't stand it! I can't continue living in this clown world like this! I don't want to.

I'm running out of time and life force. I'm looking for any advice as far as jobs which might help me live more peacefully. Because I need money to survive. In or outside the USA, doesn't matter. I hate the American way of life, and unfortunately it has been exported to most of the world. I hate consumerism, the fast pace, materialism, personal value tied to your job, the arrogance, the phoniness, the meanness, etc. Here are some criteria:

1. Don't deal with many people or bullshit
2. Doesn't pay a slave wage
3. A job where work stays at work. You don't go home thinking about work and needing to do anything work related.
4. Quiet, stress-free, easy on the mind and spirit. A job that will not induce negative feelings/thoughts to a person like me. 
5. A job where employment is secure for the next 20 years - no constant firings/replacements, resilient to economic downturns and technology advancement, etc.
6. Provides health insurance so I can try to improve my back, stomach, and other health problems without getting into a big debt. Hopefully the stupid doctors find the issues, and not make my health worse. 
7. A job that sort of provides freedom and independence. Where I could actually make most decisions myself, and feel like I don't have a boss (if I don't actually have a boss and coworkers, even better). Not time based, flexible. 

Maybe an easy to learn trade (fast and inexpensive to learn/get license/schooling) for a genetically weak person? (I couldn't do something like oil rig working/lumberjack/etc.)

Maybe something within the education field? Maybe get a Master's for a more peaceful job?

Or maybe a master's degree in something highly in demand and not to taxing to a person with my issues?

I don't know, as I said, I'm lost.

I grew up in a terrible home situation and to avoid getting beat up by my dad I learned the fucked up skill of being a really good liar. This is not an excuse, I know it’s not okay, but just to give you guys a little glimpse as to how I picked it up. It’s compulsive sometimes and I’ve gotten good at catching myself, but there have been a few time that I didn’t and now I’m pretty deep into it. I want to get out. I want to stop the cycle.

I find myself lying about things I’ve done that I’m ashamed of. The two I’m asking about that I need advice on are these:

1. I’ve lied to my boyfriend about never doing coke, and 2. I’ve lied to him about never smoking a cigarette. I did coke 2-3 times in one night and never again after that. I’ve smoked probably 5 cigs in my life but still did it none the less. 

I was so ashamed that I just spun a web about how I would never do anything like that, it’s disgusting, etc.

So how to I bring this up? How do I tell him? I don’t want to lose him. He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I don’t know where I’ll be if he leaves.

I don’t know how he’ll  react but honestly however it goes is how it goes because I know I fucked up and it’s my fault and no one else’s.

356,What to do when your friend is being distant?,"I have a friend who used to seem really happy when we texted, liked all my ig posts, and even implied that she wanted our friendship to get grow. Although she has been acting weird since I requested to follow her boyfriend on instagram (which I even told her I had no ill intentions and that other people don’t have an issue with it). She sent me a text on how weird it was since I didn’t know him and I admittedly got defensive. It’s been over a month and she hasn’t tried connecting with me. I tried to be friendly by writing nice comments on her ig and recently sent her a few texts, but she hasn’t liked any of my recent ig posts and replied to one text, but not the others. I really do want to continue on being friends and I want to let bygones to be bygones, especially since I don’t think the drama is worth ruining a friendship. It’s not like it seems she’s going through a difficult time since she seems to be posting frequently on social media and looks happy. Seems like she just has a problem with me.",1

812,I don’t know who I am anymore,"I’m going through a bit of an identity crisis and could use some advice. 

First off a little background about me is that I’ve had a very rough childhood that left me with absolutely no self esteem or confidence. This along with wanting desperately to fit in and be normal like everyone else, caused me to spend my teen years trying very hard to hard to emulate my favorite fictional characters. I figured since I liked those characters and other people did too that if I could become just like them I would be liked by others and like myself. It’s stupid I know, but in doing that I seem to have lost myself. Every time I failed at trying to be someone I wasn’t I would feel even worse about myself. It didn’t matter which character I tried to copy, I kept failing. More things in my life then took a turn for the worst and I had to drop out of high school. 

Now I’m in my early twenties and feeling very lost in the world. I don’t know who I am anymore. I know simple things like my favorite color but not what I want or need in life. Everything seems to be crumbling around me. I don’t know who I am underneath the depression and anxiety I’ve struggled with for so long. I look back to the early years of my childhood and remember being such a different person than I am today. Fear and despair rule my life and I want so badly to take control but I don’t know how. I want to know who I am outside of all this. How do I know which parts of me are the real me vs. things I’ve acquired overtime from events in my life going a certain way? Am I really the sarcastic, cynical, pessimistic person I seem to have become? My mom often talks about how I used to be so cheerful and outgoing when I was little as opposed to how shy I am now. How do I find these parts of me that have faded away? Do I even want to go back to the way I used to be? And who exactly is that? I’m not sure I can find happiness amidst all the darkness in my life. But I want to, I just don’t see how. I want so badly to grow up and mature like everyone else my age has done, I feel like a little kid stuck in an adult’s body most of the time. I have such poor social skills, I don’t know how to drive, I don’t have enough education to get a job. How can I fix everything and become the person I’m meant to be? How do I find my true self?

Please help me. I feel so lost and confused.",1

545,Should I drop out of college for a business my friend and I started?,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this question, but I have been looking for some advice as to whether I should drop out of college or not. 

So far I am a couple of months into my second year of college (U.S.) and I have been working on a business with a friend. At first, I thought I would be able to run the company at the same time I went to class, but as we have expanded, my time for school has decreased dramatically. we went to our first convention to market our product and made upwards of $50k in pre-orders in the first two hours that we were talking to people, so we know that there are people who would be willing to buy our product. I already own a relatively successful photography company that has just enough business to keep me busy on the weekends, but starting this business is eating up all of the remaining time I have leftover. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pros that I see about ending my semester early and dropping out are:

I would be able to devote more time to going to events and finding clients for the business

My friend would feel like we are equally invested in the company (he already dropped out)

I would have more free time ( I feel like I am constantly overwhelmed by running two businesses and attending a full class schedule)

&amp;#x200B;

The cons:

I would lose my scholarship (8k per semester)

My parents really want me to finish school

I lose out on the ""college experience"" (I am 20)

I am fairly torn at this point because I have a great opportunity sitting in front of me at the moment that needs my attention. If this is a success, then I would gladly work for this company. entrepreneurship is something I have always done. I started my current business at the age of 16 which has grown into a production and photography company that has done projects for Netflix, Animal Planet, and the UFC. I love the grind of starting new businesses and I know that I am capable of starting another, but I also know how important it is to finish school. What is your take?",1

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot.

The little brother ended up leaving the discord, a few days later a random discord user added him a possible throwaway account. The throwaway account said "" say hi to the cops and enjoy the pizza"" the cops ended up coming to the house under the pretense of a possible suicide being underway and 10 inedible pizzas were delivered to the house ( just a bunch of gross random toppings) . The little brother has no clue how he ascertained his house information and possibly his home phone records. The cops traced the call back to another person who has been a reoccurring victim from this person for the past 5 months and their parents are at a loss of what to do aswell, the Discord guy ended up spoofing his number to make the call.

285,"I (17 F) truly believe that if I don’t get a 3.8+ GPA, I won’t be able to be accepted into a good job with good benefits and I will end up poor","It sounds irrational, doesn’t it?

Now, lemme tell you. If one of my friends came up to me with this nonsense, I would laugh, but as soon as I found out I have D in my first college class of my first semester, I was on this slippery slope of thinking; a panic attack.

My parents know that I’m the most academically smart compared to my brother and sister who are also in college and thus put lots of pressure on me. They preach that I should be getting a 3.8 or higher ad nauseam. I try to brush it off, but as soon as I get something below an A, I freak out. I start panicking about changing my major, I start to worry that my employer will look at D on my transcript and throw me all out together, despite having really great people skills (I enjoy public speaking and am able to empathize with a wide amount of people, I always work hard when a temporary job comes about). 

I feel like my goal has been to work hard to make money. That’s what my dad has always told me, hence why I began with a computer science major (I don’t even like computer science, interesting and all but not something I would want to do). I LOVE learning but learning for the goal money makes me anxious and pressured and I hate it. 

I know it’s okay to get a D in my first year especially with what my parents have taught me and the fact I accept those beliefs. I want to rip those ugly arbitrary beliefs out of my head because they give me literal headaches. I want to relax and know that yeah, probably my employer won’t give too much of a fuck of my grades but about my character.",1

852,Please help me :(,"So, I’m posting here because I have no one to speak about this to in my real life - so please be gentle, I know I am in the wrong here. 

A few weeks ago I went for a drink with an ex after not having seen each other for almost 6 years - we met up for a drink having spent some time texting each other over the space of a couple of months. 

To give some back story of the original relationship, we were together for 4 months, he broke up with me after an accident and then he moved on pretty quickly with a girl he had been messaging whilst we were together... he also gave me chlamydia, denied it and then went on to give it to the girl he got with after me. 

We hadn’t seen each other since the messy messy breakup, and I spent two years in a relationship with one of his best friends. 

You could say it was against both of our better judgements to meet up in the first place - but fuck it, it happened. I ended up missing my last train and stayed at his, of course, as you would expect we slept together despite both knowing / being in relationships. 

At the time I had thought not much of it, but now we have met up a few more times and behaved in the same way, as well as constantly being in contact over text and we have both said to each other that there is now feelings there - we have these shared fantasies about living and being together. 

But, ultimately, we are both still in relationships and there’s a lot of history there - it’s very complicated and goes even deeper than touched on above. 

Am I being an idiot for even thinking that it could work? Is there any chance that we could ever trust each other? Am I wasting my time? Should I stay with a safe relationship rather than take this risk? Am I going to be the one that is hurt at the end of all this? Am I going to hell?

327,Am I a psychopath?,"I know a lot of teenagers go through this but I have a feeling that my situation could be serious. Go to the end if you don’t want to read this next part as I will have a summary there. It started in school when I was in school. I didn’t have any friends and at lunch I sat outside on a curb and fiddled with rocks. This was literally every break and lunch in school for well over a year. Sometimes the most popular girls in my class would come over and talk to me which I liked but there was something that drove them away.

 When I was 8 I had 2 friends in school who lived nowhere near me. I’d go to their houses occasionally and they would come to mine. This was the first year that I wanted to die. I don’t know why but I was really really sad and I vividly remember going up to one of my friends and asking him to kill me. I wanted him to with all of my heart but he obviously didn’t. I asked another guy in my class and he also refused to do it. I began to realize that wasn’t the way to go. I doubt these were mood swings as I was 8 and I hit puberty around 10 (TMI).

 I had more friends the next year, including those girls I mentioned earlier, and so I had a Halloween party at my house. I was really sad again so I told one of my friends to come with me in the kitchen. I remember she was confused and I handed her a sharp kitchen knife and asked her to slit my throat. She didn’t for obvious reasons. Later that year in school she asked me to run away with her. I agreed to it but we never got to it. I ended up having a crush on her and we seemed to have a good thing going until I saw her kissing my friend. I spent weeks making proper plans to torture and kill them both despite the fact that I like both of them. My parents found my plans and gave out to me for thinking of something like that.

I went through more loneliness through school and left for the last year of primary school (the one from around age 5 to 12) because I really didn’t like my teacher. I was so lonely and sad until the school holidays and the next year I started secondary school AKA high school. Only one of my friends from my previous school was in my class and I was unable to fit in with anyone else meaning that I made no other friends. I hung myself from the forest behind my house but a branch snapped and I fell (It was funny I’ll admit) and I was scared to try it again. My parents found my suicide note when I left the house and took me to see a therapist. She wasn’t much help so I had to see two more and visit a house for people with depression. I WAS THIRTEEN. I lied to everyone I spoke to because I was afraid of telling them my feelings for some stupid reason.

I’m now 15 and instead of wanting to kill my self I want to kill others, really bad. I think of horrible things I could do to innocent people out in public. I don’t talk and I made a plan to shoot up the school but my friend talked me out of it. I really really want to kill someone and I have the ability to do so. I’d do it if it wasn’t for the consequences. I was thinking of getting more therapy but the thing is I like being like this. I barely eat for some reason (sorry I forgot to mention it earlier) and I just feel like others are the cause of my sadness and that they can’t just get away with it. I need to fix it.

Nothing too serious or anything, I'm not depressed, not suicidal, nothing like that. So I'm a 15 year old male, in a oddly specific situation rn. Starting off a year ago, I met a girl in a speech class, lets call her Jenny, Jenny and I hit it off, she had a bf but soon after they had a breakup. her and I were very good platonic friends, she introduced me into a lot of the hobbies I have now, and most of the friends I have now. without these ppl idk where i'd be, they're the best things to ever happen to me. later on, about six months later, her and I both confessed to crushes on each other, we planned on dating, her parents noped the hell outta that and being stupid, we decided to go behind their backs. That was dumb and short lived, in hindsight they prolly found out, but after a long complicated chain of events they ended up rlly rlly disliking me. in April there was a party at her house I went to, had several panic attacks in the bathroom bc of family things and things I was having to help my friends through. I ended up saying some things I shouldn't have in that setting, just some dirty jokes, nothing horrible, but it was enough to make the overly religious (I'm religious but not near at their level) parents think I was the spawn of Satan. I almost lost her and everyone else in my life, other than one friend who we'll call Rebecca. Rebecca counseled me through a lot, and ended up getting me back out of my depression of not eating and barely getting out of bed. Things are looking up now, and in June, Jenny and I decided we were gonna wait for each other. she's allowed to date at 18 probably, but it's not like they can stop her. it will be a year and 2 months from now that she's 18, I'll be 17 or 16 maybe when that hits. and listen, I get I'm 15, I'm young dumb and in love, yadda yadda yadda. but I really do love Jenny with all my heart, and she feels the same way. I'd like nothing more than to spend my life with her. it might not last, it might last. but I really do love her more than anyone I've ever loved before, and she's everything to me. tensions with her parents have cooled down, it's pretty chill now, that's not my issue. I'm just a lil concerned that I'm making a horrible decision in waiting for each other. We see each other on average around 4 or 5 times a week, in a platonic setting of course. we came to an agreement with Rebecca, who is the best friend of both of us, that every major holiday we'd all watch a movie and Jenny and I can cuddle and hold hands and all, so that's the only romance we have between us, other than some text conversations here and there talking about what we want in the future and all. I just wanted to know if anyone thought I was being majorly stupid, if so, please tell me and give me ur advice. I'm not willing to give her up, but if there's a better way to go about this, then I'm open to suggestions.

TL;DR
Met a girl, she introduced me to most my friends. Feelings developed on both parts, turned into love. She's not allowed to date, we're waiting on each other, it'll be a year and a half till we can date, is this a mistake?",1

I am currently home for the weekend and I just can't help but feel sick to my stomach the whole time I'm here because I really don't want to go back to school tonight. And I have everything going for me back at school: I love my major, the people I live with are all really nice and we get along well, I have really close friends going to the same university as me from high school, and I have actually made some new friends in some my classes. But it just feels wrong to go back. I know this is probably just me being homesick, but it's preventing me from enjoying the time that I am having at home.

So, I'm looking for advice from current college students or grads who can share their experience on how they transitioned to college. I feel like so many people around me were excited to leave home and I'm not experiencing the same thing.",1

I have done my best to avoid my parents and grandparents whilst this has been happening. I know it’d be as simple as asking them what I can do, but I’m honestly afraid to confront any of my fears head on. I feel ashamed and alone.

I really just wish everything could go back to the way it used to be, not even a year ago my family was free of any major health issues. But now everyday is seems as if I’m losing each of them, one by one.

I’m still young and can’t even face the prospect of moving out. I’m so scared.

646,Can you restore your life no matter what point in life?,"I feel gloomy and hopeless and weak. It’s even a sin because it’s a commandment to be joyful but I find it hard to not have a look of concern and anxiety and sadness around people.  I don’t blame others if they wouldn’t feel comfortable around me and this mindset digs me into a deeper pit. There’s always something bogging me down. I look at people with worse situations who look powerful and happy and upright and I have a tiny problem and feel doomed.

For example I’m so down about a knee injury I have had for months that’s been aching and messing with me, when there is someone I know who is in a wheel chair and always tells people at least you have legs.

I keep telling myself to fix this problem and be strong and joyful but it continues to drag on day by day and I’m afraid it will get worse.

Any advice would be appreciated.",1

Okay, so there is this girl I've met in uni. We were both freshmen at the time, and we had a lot of classes together. When I first saw her I felt like I was in some cheesy romantic movie: I was stunned, stood there like a retard with his thumb up his ass, and my friend had to call my name twice before I could react. She was amazing: she wasnt the typical hot girl, more like extremely cute. I thought to myself ""I'm gonna marry this girl."" Then during classes, I noticed that she was looking at me a lot. Like, an unreasonable amount. She didn't look away right away when we locked eyes either, she just smiled and then looked away. We had to give presentations, and she was looking at me while I was doing mine, while everyone else was looking around bored, or just sleeping in general( I dont blame them, the topic was very boring). And when she was doing hers, she switched between me and the teacher, she didn't even look at the class. So I was pretty damn sure she fancied me too, and we started talking. As I soon found out, she had a boyfriend (still does, same guy). I was devastated, and to not make it look like I was hitting on a taken girl, I immediately shot down my advances. We were still talking, looking and smiling at each other, but I have given up on asking her out on a date. Until one day, she did. She asked if I'll go to this party on wednesday, and when I said I dont think so, she said that I really should, and she will be there too. I said fuck it, I'll go. So I went out on wednesday, met up with her earlier, and we walked to the party together. There we spent 4(!) whole hours talking, laughing, and getting to know each other. And we found out, that we had ridicoulusly lot in common. She liked the same music as I did, same tv shows, same movies, both of us had similar hobbies etc. It seemed like we really hit it off, we both seemed to have a really good time. She took off relatively early because she had classes tomorrow morning, so I walked her to the tram, got a kiss on the cheek, and she left me there with my heart full of gooey, cheesy romantic thoughts. She absolutely, and irretrievably claimed my heart, and when I went back, my mates told me I was looking like someone who just won the lottery or something, because I had a smile as big as the Moon. I went home not long after too, felt like there was no point in staying anymore. Then months went by, we still talked regularly, I still didn't make a move because of her bf. I invited her to a few parties, she accepted a few times, seemed like we were stuck. One day, I couldnt take it anymore, and asked one of her friends on facebook about her relationship with his bf. She said they've been together for almost 2 years, and they seemed pretty serious. They both are really religious, and travel a lot together. I was pretty damn sad to hear this, and tried to like limit our communications, so I could try to start to forget her somehow. It worked somewhat, I still dreamt about a timeline where her bf never existed, and we were living happily ever after. It helped that she switched universities halfway through the year, so I didn't see her at all after that, we didn't even talk outside of a few declined invitations on my part. 8 months went by, and it was the October of 2019. I wasnt thinking about her actively anymore, she sometimes just popped into my head every few days or so. And then two days ago, I saw her on the tram. She was as beautiful as ever, and my heart stopped when I saw her. She noticed me, and she had a huge smile on her face. She didn't come over, just kept smiling, and switching between me and the window. She got off a few stops later, and I immediately started thinking about her again, like the last 8 months didn't even happen. The feelings I had last year came back as strong as ever, and I'm feeling like shit currently. How will I able to forget her? She still has her bf, I see their pictures on social media, and I dont want to be a girl-stealing guy. I can't hit her up, but I can't forget her either, I just feel like we still have something to do with each other in the future.
She also made my love life impossible, I've tried dating other girls, had a few dates, one night stands, but in the morning I always felt like shit, so I stopped trying entirely. Will I ever be able to forget her and move on? Or will this happen every time I see her somewhere for the rest of my life? Please help if you have any piece of advice, or idea or something, I'd really appreciate it.

I feel that she’s been playing a little bit of games on me to catch my interest but I’m not sure if I’m overthinking it. There are times where I have tried to get a conversation going but it would usually result in not getting much of a reply which I assume is because it was a sort of stale starter. Nonetheless she has not broken contact with me, even thou we don’t talk much. Right now, I’m sure she’s checking out another guy and I’m not sure if I should just go for it or if I just need someone to talk some sense into me.

494,Debating on Taking a job and moving,"So I work in health care and applied to a different job in a different city and was just offered the job. This city is 90miles from where I currently live. I wanted to see what the offer would be and subconsciously because I enjoy the city is located.
I (m)am have been in a relationship for just over a year (f). She finishes school for teaching this winter and wants to work in the school district that we currently live in. Fyi we dont live together but have talked about it. She states she probably wouldn't want to move there so it would be sort of long distance.
The job I currently work is 12hr nights every 3rd weekend and 3rd holiday. Mu schedule is blocked to where I will work for 2-5 days in a row and have 3-7 days off in a row, which is nice. The new job would be 4, 10hr shifts Monday-thurs, no weekends or holidays. The pay is $0.20 more for the new job. The current job is more hands on patient care, the potential job is more insurance side/case management/office work. 
So I would like the job because I'm not necessarily happy with what I'm doing now, but I am comfortable. But moving would mean being away from my girlfriend. We really only hang out on weekends but we see each other during the week for a few hrs. We talked about if I took the job that we would make it work.

Completely anonymous in every way. My friend said she would report them to the online police but honestly, they don’t care. The police do not care about this stuff - it’s online and I’m not dead.

268,AITA for leaving my boyfriend at the mall?,"It all started the previous night when My bf (32M) was making dinner for himself in my kitchen. We don't live together. I (31F) check up on him to see if he needs any help finding where stuff are. He was making lentil soup and asked for advice with what to do to with it, to either have the soup separately or mix it with the zoodles he was making. I told him just eat it separately and he said okay and asked what to do to flavour the soup so I asked him, do you want me to flavour it? He said yeah sure. So I go ahead and do that, but I fucked up by adding too much spices and I didn't know that he hates Indian flavours. And so he gets mad at me the entire evening for ruining his dinner. Blames all of it on me. Next day I wake up early to go to work (he doesn't have to do that because he works remotely and has a lot of free time). I come home exhausted and hungry and dizzy from a very physically demanding and mentally and emotionally draining job, and he's all quiet and has that look on his face when he's pissed off. I know it all too well. He tells me that he wants to go back to his place so I said okay sure. This was the night before our anniversary btw. But he said that he had a concall meeting to work on a project, so I left it alone even if it means we weren't going to be together for our anniversary. He seemed to still be pissy about his dinner the night before though but I was too tired to ask at this point. He asked if we could go to the mall (the bus station was here too) early to have dinner so I said okay wake me up at 6.15pm so we could go (his bus leaves at 8.10pm). As we went outside my apartment he's mad because he said I never agreed to dinner and that I told him to wake me up at 6pm,when I know I said 6.15. Anyway, we get to the mall before 7pm and he was walking ahead of me purposely, not even glancing to see if I'm still following. Meanwhile I'm so dizzy and hungry trying to keep up with him so I told him to slow down, he mocks me by walking extremely slow. So I get pissed off and told him to just go walk at his own pace. So he walked away, and fast. He acted as if he didn't have a companion with him. When I finally got fed up, I told him if you wanted to be alone just tell me! And I left him at the mall to go find the bus stop. And I don't even know why he was in such a hurry, we were one hour early. Then he later said that his pants were falling and that he was carrying a heavy bag but imo it was no excuse to act as if he didn't have me around. Like wtf, who does that? And all of this happened without it being communicated to me. It was a dick move to just leave him but he really moved as if he wanted to get away from me. And he didn't even consider the condition that I was in following him around. Am I the asshole for abandoning him at the mall?",1

115,"Roommate trouble, should I stay or leave?","This is long, so please hang in there. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Let me start by giving some very much needed context. I’m 23, she’s 24. I’ve known this person for about two years. She lives in a townhouse that her dad bought for her after she graduated high school. Her dad currently pays the mortgage and the home owners insurance on this townhouse, as well has her car payment and car insurance. Before me, her ex-boyfriend was still living with her and was her current “roommate” (he didn’t have a job, didn’t help with housework, they still slept in the same bed. It’s a long story) I was, and still am, facing a less than ideal situation living with my parents, and she was offering  me space a space in this townhouse after she got him to move out. He’s been gone almost 3 weeks, I’ve been there a week. 

Let me continue in clarifying that she has been unemployed now for 4 months, and her dad has been paying her bills. Not only her bills, but comes into town maybe once a month/every 2 weeks to buys her groceries and anything she needs for the house. I didn’t know this until after I had already agreed to move in. When I moved in we agreed that I would be paying half the bills, and she told me her dad would continue to pay her half of the bills until she could support herself. She found a job about a month ago, but quit during her first couple days of training (it was a serving job) She never told her dad she quit, and told him she still needs help because they’re not scheduling her enough. She had scheduled an interview for this past Friday, but never mentioned it again, so I honestly don’t even know if she went. First red flag I shouldn’t have ignored. I honestly don’t know what she’s been doing with her time over these 4 months. I know she spends a lot of her time smoking weed, which I have nothing against and partake in occasionally myself, but never to the extend she does. She’ll smoke maybe 4 or 5 blunts a day, and told me she’ll do whatever she can to got her hands on and smoke weed all day. 

I understood, as she had told me, that the place needed work. She currently has 6 animals (2 medium size dogs and 4 cats) in the townhouse and I understood that there was a urine smell in this place. I wanted to work with her and help her turn this townhouse into a livable space for both of us, so I was willing to work with her and get the place clean. I had gone to the townhouse before I started moving anything, and the smell was extremely strong. Like, make your eyes water and your nose burn strong. It hits you as soon as you open the door. But still, I remained optimistic in hopes that we could turn this into a livable space.  I know this is a big red flag and a huge fuck up on my part. 

I moved most of my belongings I could into this house, but before I could do anything in what would be my room I wanted to clean the carpets. I had a large Bissell push carpet scrubber I borrowed from a family member I planned on using. Guys, it took me 2 days and three rounds of scrubbing the get the water coming out of the machine to not be a dark brown. While I did this she smoked weed and made lists of what we needed to do. The bathroom of this room was used as a liter box space for the cats and remained that way until I moved in. She took the litter box out and and swept and swiffered the first day I worked on the carpets. After that I was on my own. She told me that she had been working to clean the house the last could weeks and it was cleaner now than it was before. Guys. The fridge and handles were covered in dirt and grime and smudges. The banister of the stairs was the same, and instead of being the white is was originally was dark brown and covered in dirt. The walls are covered in smudges. Everything is just filthy. It didn’t really hit me until my second night there how dirty the place is. I feel like I’m living in a crack house. We had to clean slime out of the water/detergent tray in her fancy washing machine before I could was my clothes for work. I’m paranoid going into work that myself, clothes, and bag are going to smell like the strong urine smell in this house. I got my stuff into this room, which smell 10x better than the rest of the house, but the smell still lingers in this room. It stinks right outside my door, so that contributes to the lingering smell in my room, and the AC cycles air from around the house, so that causes the smell to present itself in my room as well. I just feel dirty being in this house. 

All this is definitely a factor in why I no longer want to be there, but there’s so much more. After my first night there she told me she had an opportunity to spend the weekend with her current boyfriend and would be gone from Friday to Sunday. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to get home Saturday to let the dogs out of their crates as I had to be at work all day, and since I didn’t have a car it would cost me $30 to uber to her place and back to work and that I couldn’t afford it. She told me they’d have just have to stay in their crates until I got home and that that’s just how it is. I would be gone at work for 11 hours. I told her I’d really feel more comfortable if she could get home on Saturday and let the dogs out and she told me she’d try. (She did, thank god. I would have found a way to get over there if she didn’t) The dogs are let outside every morning, and occasionally during the day, but they mainly using the bathroom on peed pads that are laid out around the house. She doesn’t want to take them out at night as she feels it’s not safe. I feel so bad for these dogs. The cats are extremely skittish and there’s only two I’ve seen often, the other two I can probably count on one hand the  amount of times I’ve seen them. She left for the weekend with her boyfriend, and left me with a list of stuff to do to take care of the animals. Refill food and water in the morning, clean up from and replace pee pads, let the dogs out, cage them before I leave, clean up from and replace pee pads as they use them, fill food and water before bed. Wash rinse repeat. I had been there for three nights and she left. She told me the dogs sleep with her at night and can’t go the night without someone to sleep with them, so I had to sleep in her bed for two nights. I didn’t want to let them into the room I worked hard to clean and have them get fur everywhere, as I’m allergic to dogs. They sleep with blankets on top them and kept digging at my back trying to get under my blankets when they couldn’t find out how to get back under theirs. I got like 4 hours of sleep both nights. 
 
I told her in my second night I was having second thoughts about living there and was having a hard time. I left my family and my own two cats behind to move in with her. I didn’t think it was safe to try and move them into a house with 6 other animals. My roommate told me she thought it was a good idea to give it the weekend and see how I feel. I agreed. It didn’t hit me until later that part of the reason she suggested that is so I’d be there to take care of the animals so she could still spend the weekend with her boyfriend. 

I know that the place could eventually be turned into a livable space, but it would take so much time and money, two things I never have much of. It would also take a huge amount of effort, something I don’t know if my roommate would contribute. The smell is so bad in this place the only this that is going to eliminate it is getting the carpets replaced. I can’t afford that, even if her dad contributes half. I’m moving again in May anyway. She told me she wanted to open her house up to me to get me out of my current negative living situation, but I think she’s kind of blind to the negativity in her house. Her place is probably more negative that my past living situation, just in different ways. All of this and I haven’t even gotten into just how she is as a person, and her past of lying to people, including her past and present boyfriend. (She was still living and sleeping with her ex while dating her current boyfriend. Neither of them knew. They’re currently in a poly relationship, current boyfriend forgave her.) Spending all this time with her this last week has made me realize how different our personalities are. 

I know this is a lot, but I feel guilty for wanting to remove myself from this situation. I told her today I want to move my stuff out. I’m stayed at my parent’s place last night and am there now. I told her we could talk more about it when I see her. She told me “I don’t have much talk in me today.” I feel like I’m fucking her over when it comes to the animals, but I know she’s still be supported when it comes to bills. Should I try and improve the situation, or should I just leave and move back in with my parents? 

TL;DR Moved in to friends townhouse her dad bought her like 6 years ago, the place is disgusting and smells extremely strong of urine. 6 animals in the house, the place is caked in dirt and grime and feels like a crack house. Her dad pays for everything, including mortgage, car and house insurance,  car payment, all her bills, and her groceries. She lied to him about having a job. She’s lied to other people. She smokes weed all day and seems unbothered by the state of the house. Making the space livable would take a lot of time and money, but I’m moving again in May. I’ve been there for a week. I told her I would pay half the bills, but her dad was already paying all of them. Should I stay or move back out?",1
834,I just need to rant sorry,"I'm hoping to get married next year in June. It's still in the process, so there's some back and forth on dates. I barely get along with my mother, my stepfather has sent me two abusive text messages in the past and is emotionally unavailable through my entire life even though I've known and lived with him since I was four. I don't have a bio dad becuase he's a piece of shit pedophile. My SO is wonderful and trying to support me but my family can't give me a break. My brother is just turning 18 and is set to get all top grades at school in exams coming up. Those exams spill into June, which I appreciate must be damn hard to study for and stressful planning for uni. I'm not unsympathetic in the least. But bare in mind, these are all weekday exams and I've been planning for a weekend wedding. He would have to stay overnight (as in, travel up to the wedding on Saturday and stay the night and go home Sunday). Its a three hour drive. I get it, he's going to be stressed and need to study. But it's a weekend wedding. 

My mother, whom I have not spoken to in months due to her literally telling me that it didn't matter I was suicidal as a teen becuase I'm not my sister, asked my brother what his plan was if the wedding was in June. I wasn't there to hear how she said it so no play by play, but my brother said that he wouldn't come becuase would get in the way of his work. Which isn't on the weekend. No questions or maybe or checking what day, just outright it is out of the question if I choose to get married during exams.

Okay, ao let's pretend I do it outside of exams - that leave me with the 25th, 26th, and 27th of June. Becuase darling brother is going on holiday after that so he's unavailable. So I have three options to book it or he won't come. AND my mother made sure when she told my grandmother this (cuz she'd never dream of talking to me when I so rudely said I had been suicidal, becuase how fucking dare I) that my poor darling brother couldnt be left alone at 18 in the house in the exceptional nice area they live in (no sarcasm) and that stepfather would have to stay behind too. Like I know he's a dick but God damn he raised me since I was four he can come to my fucking wedding!!??

So yeah. I feel wonderful, my emotions are stable, I don't want anyone to die in a car crash and life is great.

My question is, how am I even meant to deal with that? I want to invite the family, I want to try. I shall never have a great relationship between my mother, stepfather and I, but I have hoped I would with my brother. My sister is great but going through a lot and only 14, she's coming and going to be a bridesmaid. My brother is meant to be a groomsman. I get the feeling he just doesn't care and thinks this is a farce. I am young getting married so maybe he thinks it'll end in tears and doesn't know how to pretend to be supportive in the meantime? I have no idea anymore and I'm spiraling and I don't give a shit but also want to bite my finger off :) thanks for listening to my sob story",1

904,I feel super uncomfortable during sports,"This year I transferred to a new school. One of the things I quickly realized is that almost everybody is really into sports and takes it hella seriously. I’m not one of those people. I barely play sports, but I do fitness and workout in my spare time so I’m not completely out of touch with physical fitness. 

I initially tried to put in effort but I knew that I wouldn’t get anywhere because I’m really bad at sports. I’ve never succeeded. 

Anyways, once actual sports lessons started, I chose to go for basketball. The coach seemed ok but he never really puts in effort to really teach others. A couple of classes in I ended up twisting my ankle and I was in a cast for a few weeks and couldn’t do much physical activity for a month or so. 

After it healed I suddenly got really scared of movement in school. The people at this basketball class are really talented and I can’t come to their level at all. So I tried to put in any excuse I can to skip playing or going for sports. I also realized something about the coach that made me severely dislike him. 

Beginning from tomorrow I’ll probably have no option but to attend this class and play. But I’m really embarrassed about my lack of skill and at this point I’m even fearful about playing.

In all honesty I have no interest in this sport and the only other sport available is Football, and it’s the exact same story as this. The only sport I like is golf, and no way in hell will our school ever have that. 

How do I get myself to even remotely perform in this class?",1

Because i feel like most people get the feelin people only say things like this if they want something in return, or something like that. Atleast that's how I feel.

Like when smaller people compliment the bigger fella, It just seems like they're just trying to network a good amount of the time, and the connotation there is for the most part selfishness. Especially when it comes to the music industry or any kind of industry for the most part.

If I compliment someones physical appearance it could be seen as creepy or something along those lines.

755,Does she talk down to me and patronise me especially since I got a job? Feel insecure about it," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",1

The state got involved because he made a bogus accusation that she wanted to kill him and the baby. So she now has to go to mental health counseling. However, until the case is closed, she cannot be alone with the baby and the aunt (babys fathers sister) has to go back to work and his mom is going out of town so the state has to take her baby into temporary care. My mom refuses to take my sister in (shes very JustNo) but offered to take the baby in because my mom loves babies. I tried talking to my mom about taking both my sister and my niece in but its excuse after excuse why she can't take both.

I'm halfway across the country and I'm absolutely clueless on how to be there for her and advise her to stay on track. I'm terrified her separation anxiety is going to crush her once the state takes my niece. 

So I guess my question is how to be there for her as far away from her as i am during this time until she can get my niece back into her custody.",1

Hi! So basically, I'm in high school and the IB program here, and I'm starting to like this girl. I liked her about two years ago because she had a kind of atmosphere around her that said that she had more to say than she let on (she barely talks, and when she does, it's almost a whisper). I moved on originally though, because I figured it would be impossible, seeing that we were in different friend groups. 

However, now the entire IB group is one big friend group by itself, and as I talked with her more and more, I realized she actually is incredibly funny, sweet, and starting to open up. She has started telling me about a few personal stuff and proposed that we make a singing duet group thingy since we both sing (another thing I didn't know about her until recently).

Should I take this as a good sign? There are other little things, like her jokingly giving a metal aglet thing broken off from her jacket, or her laughing ironically to my puns. I don't want to jump to conclusions by finding signs that aren't there, but at the same time... She's just a great person. Please help?",1

I am now 19 going to turn 20 years old in 15 days. I have tried many different things throughout the years and I finally got put on accutane last month. However, I was only on 30mg for less than a month. I had 3 pills left of my first month before I had to stop because I was getting really bad headaches. Obviously one month on that low of a dose isn’t going to stop my acne, and now it’s been 2 weeks since I’ve been off of it and it is worsening again. 

My acne makes me extremely suicidal. I don’t even want to do anything because people will have to look at my disgusting face and see how ugly I am. No one wants to look at that. No one wants to touch that. I’m going to have this issue for the rest of my life. I’m going to die alone because who would even want to go near me with this on my face? It hurts me so much. I hate myself. I have cried 3+ times today and it isn’t even 4pm yet. I have seriously thought about killing myself just because of my acne, not only today but so many times I can’t count. I can’t cope with it even though I’ve dealt with it for nearly 8 years. I can’t live with this forever, literally.

588,Looking for a job to pay my abusive father back so I can cut all ties [M19],"Hey guys,

I have no idea if this is the right place to ask for help or advice. I don't really know much at the current time, except that I've let my father have complete rule and treat the entire family like his personal punching bag for to long.  I live in a different state to my family (family includes mother and younger sister), Utah, and they live in California. Right now I am not in a financially independent state, and He still currently pays my tuition. (Roughly 2200 a semester) and the last $150 or so of my rent every month.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I know that sounds oh so nice of him, helping me cover my tuition and rent, but for my whole life he has been outright abusive to me, my sister, and especially my mother. I'm talking about straight up blowing up about the smallest possible things, throwing punches and threatening to use physical violence, and actually beating us up if we don't do exactly what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants it. My whole life, besides this past year when I've lived alone, has always been under his thumb and this last week I think it's reached a critical mass.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I was both talked into and somewhat forced to complete my IFR training with his money, and even though I genuinely tried my hardest to succeed in it I ended up failing the practical examination twice. This made him extremely angry, pounding on the table and screaming to see every text I've sent from my phone in the past months because he believes I'm wasting my time there, beating my mom when she stood up for me, and then beating me when I was pulling him of my mom. This is on top of the non-stop mental degradation he does, by calling all 3 of us useless, a burden, just free loading on his hard work, (he immigrated the family here from India when I was a few mo old, and while I do consider my self extremely lucky to being living in a first world country with so many more paths available, being told everyday of your life that 'You've been given a platinum spoon in your mouth' and ""You'd be nowhere without me and my hardwork, I've reached my peak), and other language to demean and mentally condition us to feel like we owe him something. My poor mother, most wonderful woman I know, bends over backward to not only take care of the family but do so many things for him, and the only things she receives back is abuse. He feels like we all owe him our entire lives, like he's entitled to walk over all over us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, he paid roughly $9,000 or so for my IFR training, and he's harping on the fact that I ""Wasted his hard earned money; that I'm a shameless bugger for failing it twice, and ""You should go commit suicide, thats the only thing someone of your caliber is capable of"". I want to pay the man back his $9,000 and continue working so I can officially and completely cut ties with him. I'd also like to pull my sister out of that family, but I don't know if that's possible at the current time.

Right now I am in a college student taking 17 credit hours and am busy with my school and lab from approx 8am-4pm everyday. Im looking for advice on what sort of other part time jobs that would be reccemonded to work around 4-5 hours more weekends. Im extremely motivated and am willing to do nearly anything but I wanted advice on how to find the most efficient job for this. I currently am working as an undergraduate research assistant at a very reputable cancer research center in the west, and plan to continue working there, even though they dont pay very much. My skill sets include lab work in things like cell culture, flow cytometry, and experimental set up, but honestly this is still a learning process for me. Im majoring in Med Lab Science looking to join an MD program when i graduate. I am extremely motivated and hardworking, and will do nearly anything to earn this money and shove it up his ass, cut all ties, and hopefully pull my sister out of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Im sorry if this isint the place for this, and for the rantiness of this post, I just, Im just so angry right now. I don't know how to process and proceed here, just looking for well, advice i guess.

One thing led to another, not sure what happened but I woke up in the hospital. Apparently someone called an ambulance because they saw me fall in the woods behind my neighborhood. 

I’m fine, nothing bad happened to me other than a few scratches and bruises. I have yet to see the hospital bill, which I’m partially freaking out about because the ambulance an ER and I’m a recent college grad with tons of debt but I’m hoping insurance will help a bit, honestly the money part is what I’m the least scared of at this moment. 

I literally could have died. I gave my phone to my friend at some point of the night so I woke up in the hospital without a way to tell anyone where I was. My gf had been almost 8 hours without knowing where I was or if I was even alive and I know it scared her a lot, and I don’t even know how to help her cope with it either, because I know she’s still anxious about it. 

I just guess I need someone to tell me that’s it’ll be okay. I’m a big over-thinker and when things don’t go as I planned them in my brain and something new happens I just don’t know how to function anymore, I just get very anxious and can’t focus on much so this is driving me crazy. This is one of those things that I never thought that could happen to me because I’m usually a careful person but these past few years have been harder for me mentally.

265,I'm having trouble dealing with some thoughts i have because of friends comments,"it's not anything suicidal or whatever, not that type of stuff.  


thing is, i live with my dad and brother, i pay things like the water/gas/tv etc, but all divided by me and my dad it gives something like 150 euros to me and he pays a little more than 500 euros.  


now, in my opinion i should not even give him 150 euros, not one of my friends do and he earns well on his job and i don't.  


but, since i live there, ( i'm 23 btw male ) i feel like i should help with the chores and financially, so that's what i do, he takes it well and was actually the one who said we should help ( the education he gave me, i consider that he gave me a good mind set for the adult life ) but it's not like he's gonna put me out if i don't help, mostly i help because i want too.  


but usually i'm embarrassed to say that i live with my family still when my friends/ co-workers don't ( the same age as me ).  


they are not from where i am and i live '' close '' to my job, they don't, so they have to rent rooms.  


but it's kinda weird for me because when they speak '' i made this meal '' and i'm like '' my dad made this meal for me '', or if i want i can buy expensive stuff ( like tattoos, guitar, whatever ) and they can't, i also have my car already payed and they don't even have a car.   


i can cook, but i hate to cook. it's like the only thing i don't do at my home but if i really need too i will, also i should feel free to spend my money as i want ( i save a lot tho ) without feeling '' bad '' for getting something they can't.  


i also never skip work and they do it a lot of times, but my boss let's them compensate the time.  


but i feel a little bit judged after all.  


what am i supposed to say when they '' joke '' about living at my dad's home, '' i'm sorry that my life its better than yours ? ''   


even tho it isn't, but i feel judged and then start making '' movies '' on my head. it's exhausting. 

  


( btw i don't live alone because i make the minimum wage ( 600 euros ) and the rents are in this moment something like 700/800 euros for a T0 ( in the best of lucks ). i always say that for renting a room i prefer to live in mine ).  


i already know i should not let this comments get to me... but they do, even tho i know they don't mean harm to me ( my friends ).

how can i deal with this '' thoughts'' ?",1
555,Rape charges,"A few months ago my friend was charged with rape by his ex girlfriend. He posted that she had cheated and the next day he was arrested. I know that he didn't do it because the timelines do not match. His trial has been put on hold because she has gone off the grid. He now has a gf which has the potential to screw his over more. Does anyone know if the charges will be dropped if she doesn't show up. Also should he have a gf right now. His PO has taken all things that are linked to anything sexual (phone,internet, things that he's able to watch porn on), but his PO allows him to have a gf which is a direct link to sex.

97,"Someone did drugs in my car, I think?","Hey! Throwaway to ask some questions. Recently, I got in my car and noticed some brownish, sticky residue over my stereo and a dab or two on the passenger door. A few eraser sized spots/globs, very little trailing. I got a little on my finger from the steering wheel, too. It was relatively sticky and shiny. I tried to wipe some with a dry napkin and it was so sticky the napkin tore. I thought maybe it was soda that I just didn’t remember spilling and forgot about it until I could get some cleaning wipes and take care of it. A day or so later, residue still in place (in the middle of planning a big move so I’m awfully scatterbrained and didn’t get to cleaning it immediately), I was digging my charge cable from between the seats and unearthed a strange pill; googled it and it turned out to be an HIV treatment pill. No one I know that regularly rides with me, nor myself is infected with HIV that I know of. Immediately stopped and cleaned up the residue with Lysol wipes and searched the car - didn’t find any paraphernalia.

There’s a couple of possibilities:
- My car HAD been stolen and returned back in July and was recovered with a bunch of stolen stuff in it. The pill could’ve been from that incident and the detailers/cops just missed it that deep in the seat valley. The residue was just soda I didn’t notice spilling.
- Someone got into my car that I accidentally left unlocked while I was at work or overnight and spilled their whatever-of-choice on the panel after it was heated, but before injection.

My advice request mostly deals with if the second possibility is true:
- Do junkies even do that? Pop into a car for a hit and then leave without stealing or rifling though anything?
- What do I need to do as far as cleanup if I’m treating it as a drug spill beyond wiping up all the residue with Lysol wipes?
- Is there any real risk of HIV exposure from the residue if, for instance, I touched some and then rubbed my eyes or picked at a tooth absentmindedly before I really noticed it’s presence or during the subsequent days? I’m thinking negligible here.

Sorry if this is a bit out there, but having my car taken from me earlier in the year and finding that pill in it has just sent me into a spiral. Thanks, Reddit and please call me crazy all you’d like!",1

5359,My wife told everyone we know that i hit her.,"A few days ago, i was due to get a promotion that i had been promised over a year ago, me and my future wife have been excited for this, and have begun looking at houses in San Francisco, we're also planning on selling thr appartement.

But i didn't get my promision. I went home to my future wife and told her. She said that everything Would be okay, and she offered me a drink. I usually don't drink but i was in a pretty bad mood, and my wife is so beautiful and sexy, that i ended up getting drunk and passing out.

Earlier today, i hear from one of our mutual friends that she told them, that i hit her, which i did not.

I have talked to my best friend about it, and my phycologist, but i am affraid that she hasnt been loyal to me.

A few hours ago, overheard her and one of her friends talking about her cheating on me, i think that she's only teasing me, but im not sure whats true or false anymore. It's reached the point where i feel that i need to setup a taperecorder, which i did in our bedroom just a few minutes ago. 

Im scared for what will happen to our relationship, i love my future wife, and i have an adopted son, who's in college.

I really want everything to turn out good, please help me. My birthday is in a few days, and i really just want to be over with this, and live on happily with my future wife and my adopted son.

&amp;#x200B;

I've pretty much always had issues with my mother but they really boiled up when I went to college and especially now that I'm graduated and living away from her city. My mother is disabled and while she can do some basic housework herself she can't drive or mow the lawn which is really rough for her and she has no one else but me to help because she is divorced. When I moved I promised I would visit at least once a month which is a promise that I have kept and I do a ton of housework when I visit and try to chat with her over the phone as much as possible. Things recently boiled over again when about two weeks ago she got mad at me and refused all contact from me when I stopped responding to her texts and calls for a few days because she was contacting me EVERY DAY and it was driving me nuts, especially since I didn't really have anything new to say. I got mad in return when she refused to talk to me and waited until she decided to call me today. She immediately starts trying to get me to visit the coming weekend and it quickly becomes apparent she has no interest in actually seeing me but just wants me to do more yard work. By the way I want to clarify I have no issues helping with her yard work but I'm her kid, not a servant and I don't like it when it seems like she only values me for the work I do. I told her I couldn't make it this weekend because I already made plans and I would try to make it the weekend after and if I couldn't do that weekend for some reason the weekend after that would definitely happen. She throws a fit and starts yelling about I hate her and don't want anything to do with her. She also threw a fit when I told her I was planning to adopt a cat and the first thing she had to say about it was yelling about how I was never going to visit now because of the cat and I was only getting the cat to avoid her. I explained that the cat will not be an issue in regards to visits but she won't listen.  She will sometimes end these arguments with telling me she has nothing to live for and I always tell her I love her and want her in my life and beyond that she needs to find her own enjoyment in life.

The email account we use is a google account, and so we often utilize googles other tools, (also on the same account throughout multiple devices.) One day I was looking through the search history on the shared account for an ad for a graphic designer that I had been talking to. While looking through our search history, I saw searches that I didn’t make (and therefore my girlfriend must have.) These searches included stuff like, “nude kids”  “teen nudes”  “naked teens”  and she had also created an account on kik that I got the password to (from apple keychain) and found that although she never enticed or inquired anyone under age to send nudes, she was talking with other adults and sending/receiving nude pictures of people who (at least claimed) to be 18. I’m not even really focused on the fact that she’s technically cheating on me, I’m just stunned that she has google searches for naked kids and teens.

&amp;#x200B;

Well hello Reddit! I can't remember the password to my old account so here's my new one :D. Anyway on to what I'm posting for. So about me: I'm Regneva (M20), currently in college and studying abroad for a year in Tokyo, Japan. (Originally from the U.S.)

Right now I feel like I'm in a major state of change in my life, where I almost always feel lost. And while I know that's perfectly fine to some degree, it's gotten to the point where day in day out I don't know what to do with my free time.

Recently I've been trying to rid my life of all low-value habits/addictions so to speak. So in other words I'm trying my best not to watch anymore Youtube, stop playing video games, and things of that nature. I want to try and find a new hobby to get into and progress in. While one could say some video games do take a lot of skill, time, and effort to get good at, and in saying so it would be a fun hobby to do, video games of just about any genre have gotten to a point where it's not fun anymore, it's just something to pass the time and keep my hands moving...

The other major hard point for me right now is I feel next to no motivation or will power to put effort into doing something once I get back from my classes at university. After 4 hours of Intensive Japanese, it's homework, and whatever other classes I have for the day, once I get back to my dorm I find it really hard to become relaxed and find enough energy to do something productive/of value. I mean I can get myself to go take a shower or eat whatever is in the fridge but attempting to do unfinished homework, read a book, prepare for tomorrows classes, or hell even going to get dinner at the store when I have no food can be a struggle, if not it feels near on impossible.

(Random thing I just thought of that may or may not have value to this post: I feel like, though I know I shouldn't, that unless something can benefit me in terms of my career in the future, or get me to reach my goal of living abroad, it doesn't feel worth doing. Like for example reading a book for fun, or watching Netflix, or playing Chess etc. It feels like a waste of time whenever I think about doing it)

Now about previous things I've done/enjoyed before. Of course I've done gaming/youtube which I'm now wanting to get away from. I've done simulation-racing, and honestly I would absolutely still do it right now, but I couldn't bring my set-up to Japan to continue it (and it takes a LOT of money to get started, so sadly not an option right now). Back in Middle School and High School I did music playing Guitar, Trumpet, and started to learn Piano, but recently this past semester when I tried to get back into music and start learning Piano again, I never felt the want to do so. I enjoy the sound of piano so I wanted to play but past liking how it sounded I never got back into music.

I've tried to get myself to draw multiple times, but everytime I can't quite seem to get myself to stick with it. I start to get bored of it after a while. I've tried Video Game Development, and for this there is just so much to learn... I feel lost getting started. I don't really know if it's for me but I might be up to try again. I've tried programming, but after learning the basics of Python, Java, and most of the basics of C++, I don't know what I want to do afterwords. I've tried researching different things to program or do, but nothing seems to interest me enough to continue.

I used to love reading back in Middle School and early High School. I get addicted to simply being told a story. I havn't read for fun in almost 6 years now.

So out of all the things I've done in the past the only 2 I can really see myself doing is sim-racing or reading, and I can't sim-race while I'm studying abroad in Japan.

So I love technology, I got into it because I was a massive gamer. I love a good story, I can easily get hooked to a good one. I love to explore and see/experience new things. That's what got me to come to Japan. Out of any type of problem I prefer logical ones. That's what got me into programming. I do love art. My favorite thing to do when I tried game design was building and creating my own levels (*also probably why I've sunk over 2000hrs into Minecraft xD*). Recently I've also come to love more and more hanging out with my friends and going out somewhere to explore or just hang out. In the past I was the introverted, stay at home, and play video games all day (*I was content with just that*).

This is what I more or less know about me so far. But I have no idea what the next step I should take is. I thought coming to Japan, to a completely new country would help solve this problem of what I should do with my life/what I should do day to day to make every day feel accomplished so to speak. But after a month, it feels like nothing has changed in that regard.

I'm almost starting to think about going to my university's counseling center about this just because it's a lot of stuff (plus more than just this for other things and reasons) and I just feel completely lost in it all.

Do you guys have any suggestions? Should I try a certain hobby again? Or maybe a different one? And how can I find the energy and motivation to do something after a day of classes in university?

716,Canadian stepping out in to the world. Nervous about taking those first steps.,"So I've been stuck living at home, in a dead-end town for all of my life. I'm 24 now. I've wanted to leave ever since I was at least 16. Couldn't leave once I graduated (because I'm not exactly wealthy). I have had medical concerns which kept me here too.

My medical set-backs seem just about taken care of now, I've got a good 13k+ (Canadian) saved up and I'm thinking this is the week that I finally quit my soul-crushing retail job. My goal in life is to make movies.

Where should I go? What should I do? I've been stuck in stasis so long, I basically didn't have a total plan worked out because every time I tried there were medical set-backs. Teased the idea of post-secondary just so I could make friends, but I'm really up in the air, if I'm honest.

I've actually, in my time here, purchased all the necessary equipment to make movies. I have a camera, a decent set of lenses, a lighting set-up, a green screen and a decent audio recorder and shotgun mic. Literally all I need is a cast and crew that are ready and willing.

My idea has always been to try and do things the Sam Raimi/Robert Rodriguez way and make my own things and try to get noticed. Just need a cast and crew to be ready and willing. Tried to get some stuff going in this small town, but a few failed attempts have come and gone and I'm at the point now where I don't know if it's going to make sense to just wait it out here and do it or if I should leap right in to a new city. I've always looked at schooling more as an opportunity to network and establish a cast and crew.
Now that it's time to actually get going, I can't help but be a little unsure of myself.",1

323,Advice on how I (27f) can stop obsessing over him (28m). It’s been many months!,"It’s been months and I’m still not over him. We only saw each other for a couple of months, and the last time we had sex was the end of May. Last phone call was in June. It wasn’t working out and he dumped me. We ran into each other at an event a month ago, and he was nice enough but it wasn’t the same.

I deleted him from all forms of social media and went no contact since June, except when we ran into one another. I’m wondering when and how I will get over him. He made an impression on me &amp; I can’t stop missing him. But he doesn’t want me— something I struggle with accepting. I haven’t met anybody else that I’ve liked since him. I’ve had plenty of guys like me, but none that I liked back. It probably also doesn’t help that i have two sex tapes of us and watch them from time to time. But I can’t get myself to get rid of them. It’s better than going out and having casual sex and getting hurt again. 

How can I stop hoping that one day we will reconnect and that he will want me again? I want to get over him for good.",1

201,"[Serious] NSFW Repressed memory I thought was not real, but recently found out it was. I'm looking for advice from both side of people who have dug deeper into repressed memories, or chose not to.","To start, yes this is a throwaway. Several people in real life know my normal Reddit account and this is not something I care for people in real life to learn about me. My husband is the only one in real life to know, but I'm not sure how much I want to explore this and dont want to put an unnecessary burden on him at the moment. Also any names mentioned in this story are fake names. 

I'm looking for advice from people who have had similar experience, who can maybe give me some guidance on whether I should explore this with professional help and what I can expect if I do. 

Several years ago, under a lot of stress and after my first time seeing a therapist (a psych evaluation was required by the job I was applying for to make sure I was not a sociopath), a repressed memory popped into my head of being sexually abused when I was a child, maybe 7-9 years old. I know I couldn't have been older than 10, because we moved to a new state when I was 10. 

All I remember is that it was a male neighbor we will name Bob who had a daughter and son. The daughter babysat me once or twice at my house. I remember she took me rollerblading at the park and my parents said I loved her as a babysitter. The son played with my brothers a lot too, back then we all played with all the neighbor kids. 

It is not a complete memory, but more so a small serious of short flashes. The main part of it was Bob and child me were in a small dark room in a basement, and he offered me a popsicle. It was dark, and I dont remember seeing anything, but I remember feeling something warm and soft and that it was not a popsicle. He was much taller than me, so I know it wasn't a kid my age. I remember there was noisy kids toys in the background, like maybe a noisy basketball game or something and maybe a lady who interrupted by yelling for Bob or me from the upstairs.

That is literally all that I remember. I am in my 30s and I told my husband about it several years ago when it first  came up. I have really vivid dreams. So we just kind of chalked it up to a weird vivid nightmare I had, under stress about everything I went through to get this new job.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My parents were back in the area where I grew up and they were visiting some of their old neighborhood friends over lunch. When my parents get back, I went to visit them with my dog. While we are out walking my dog my mom mentions that during their lunch with my old friends parents, she learned that our old nextdoor neighbor Bob got in trouble for molesting one of Bob's daughters friends. My brain clicks, but I play it cool. I dont think she knows anything by the way she brought it up, and was maybe trying to open a conversation if something did happen when I was a kid. I'm not sure, maybe she was just telling me. Either way, my mom is the kindest, sweetest most gentle lady and so I decided not to say anything about it and told myself I would revisit it at a later point when I was ready to process it. There was no point in burdening her with something that happened 20 years ago. Plus she would tell my Dad, and he would not take it well because he is super super protective of me and it would crush him as a dad to let him think this happened under his watch. I love them both very much and I'll go to my grave without telling them to protect their feelings.

So, with that said, the flash of memory that came into my brain several years ago that I pushed aside as a bad vivid nightmare was apparently something that probably actually happened. 

I even went so far as to look up the neighbors house on  google to see if it was listed as having a basement. It did. 

So, here I am, 20 years later, just having put together pieces together and discovering I was a victim of child molestation and now reading about repressed memories.

Apparently just because they are repressed, doesnt mean your brain isn't coping with it. Which makes a lot of sense, because I had a lot of emotional problems as a teenager. And my husband mentions a lot about how insecure I feel all the time. Not about my looks or body, because I am truly lucky to be in a good relationship with a man who makes me feel beautiful and who I trust with my heart and life. But I mean insecure as in someone coming after me or breaking into my house to hurt me when he isn't home. I have claustrophobia too, and dont like small spaces. Getting a brain MRI made me almost have a panic attack. My heart started racing and I had to hit the button to get pulled put to catch my breath. When he is not home, I have to sleep with the lights or TV on and bedroom door locked. As a kid, I had to always sleep with a nightlight. I remember that because my brothers thought it was always fun to prank me by turning off my nightlight.

So my question to r/advice is, has anyone had a similar experience? What did you do and what would you suggest is the best way to address this. Do you think it's better to just kind of shove it aside like it never happened since I barely remember it anywho? Or should I explore this and emotionally address it with a professional therapist?",1

552,My disabled father won’t listen to anybody.,"Sorry for the long rant. I’ve been holding this in. TLDR at the bottom. 

Some background: My dad became disabled in 2017 after a stroke. His entire right side is paralyzed. He can currently walk with a walker and can occasionally walk short distances without it (will be important latee). Ever since he’s become disabled he hasn’t listened to anyone in the house about anything. Despite my mom working nearly every day to keep us afloat he complains and gets angry that she’s “chasing money all the time” and “never stays home to take care of him” even though that’s all she does when she gets home. My mom’s scared to stand up to him because of the dynamic they had before he became disabled and because he now has the power to refuse to take his medicine if anyone makes him upset (which he’s done before). 

Now here’s where I need advice. We own 3 chickens that live in our fairly large backyard. He absolutely hates it when they come anywhere near the house because they tend to poop on the concrete and it looks gross. He does everything he can to keep them away, including throwing rocks and sandals at them any time he sees them near the house, but with them being chickens they just come righ back. He goes as far as walking all the way out to the backyard to chase them away with his walker. The momentum of the throws and the slightly unstable terrain of our backyard causes him to fall and sometimes bruise and scratch himself. Me and my mom have told him countless times to stop because the chickens dont do anything and it’s dangerous, but he doesn’t listen. I’ve tried yelling at him and he stopped for a week, but then he went right back at it. My mom told me today that we should just sell the chickens because he will not fucking listen to anything, but we’ve had the chickens for almost 5 years now and I love them. I don’t know what to do from here. Please, Reddit, tell me what to do. I’m at my wits end because of my father’s misbehavior and I can’t take it anymore.

TL;DR - Disabled father won’t listen to anyone in the house and constantly puts himself in a situation that could be life-threatening and dangerous. Me and my mom have told him to stop countless times but he won’t. What to do here?",1

5758,How can I get my neighbors to stop oppressing me,"Hello, I am I white Christian family man. I work hard on creating a family friendly lifestyle for my wife and two children.

 I purchased a home in what I thought was a good neighborhood. It all seemed great until I ran into the neighbors ( We'll call them Bruce and Jamal). When we first moved in Bruce and Jamal came to our neighborhood barbeque. They seemed to be nice young men at first and I enjoyed their company quite a bit. I even tried to set Bruce up with one of my wife's lovely nieces.

 At that point I was made aware that Bruce and Jamal where not simply roommates but were in a sinful homesexual relationship and were even ""married"". I was floored, I had let these sinners into my home and even allowed them to sit on my furniture (it has since been replaced).

 As a Christian I knew that it was my duty to save these boys. So I went to the next HOA meeting and tried to inform the other members of their perversions, but the other members already knew and said that **I** was the one who was in the wrong. I have been unsuccessful in getting Bruce and Jamal evicted or even getting them to attend church with my family.

 The two things that really upset me are 
1. Jamal and Bruce didn't even seem gay, they both talked in normal male voices and even enjoy sports and cars. I feel that if you are going to be a homesexual you should have to inform people as soon as possible.

2. Even though I have been nothing but nice my neighbors are now calling myself and my family bigots and are persecuting us for our religion.

No one has contacted me and I kept having to call back to check the status of my order. Well tonight I was about to go to sleep when I noticed the water has started leaking out of my bathroom and filling my room with water. It is 3 am here and at this rate my room will be absolutely flooded. I have already moved most of my stuff and have called the service number.

382,A high ranking church leader is having sleepovers with my five-year-old nephew,"I started living with my sister (30) and her young family when I started a new job in a new state. She and her husband are very involved in the church; from work to their personal lives, it’s all very intertwined.

Now there is a high ranking church leader (40, male, unmarried, has taken vows of chastity) whose permanent residence (when he’s not traveling for work) is nearby. He’s very close to my sister and her husband; they text, celebrate birthdays together, buy each other gifts, etc.

I started to notice, whenever this person was in town, that my five-year-old nephew would get dressed into his pjs and leave the house (pretty late after 10 pm) and then I wouldn’t see him until the next day. (This would happen on days when he didn’t have pre-school the next day).

The first time it happened, I didn’t think much of it. Then I noticed it happen again and again. One night, I asked my sister where my nephew was going. She said, nonchalantly, to this person’s residence. I was shocked. I continued asking why she allows it and if she’s okay with it. She got really defensive and said that it’s not her choice, he gets what he wants, she has to do what he wants because if she doesn’t he’ll bad mouth her, take away her job, their house (which technically is the church’s), etc. I got really heated and told her that ultimately she’s the kid’s mother and can do whatever she wants because it’s HER kid. Nothing really changed, and I stopped mentioning it even as this continued to happen.

It’s really been bothering me. Obviously I am not the kid’s parent, but he is family and this is just gives me a bad feeling. I don’t know if anything bad has or is happening, and I not trying to fabricate a false narrative, but what if this is bad? I’ve only talked to one other person about this and they suggested that maybe it’s just a sleepover like between a grandparent and grandchild. But it’s not. 

I don’t know what to do about this (or what I can even do) because this man has power, A LOT of power. And it’s scary the more I think about it. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.",1

Some background: I was in a pretty bad relationship a few years ago where sex was controlled completely by him.  My ex gave me hell for having a higher partner number than him. He called me a slut multiple times and shamed me heavily for my past. I believe I had a fairly positive relationship with sex before him, but after, I can’t look at it the same. 

Now I see sex as almost a currency. Don’t give it away too soon or the man won’t want a relationship with you. NEVER have sex on the first date, or even second date. Maybe the third but that’s pushing it. Once you have sex, all he will want is sex from you or he won’t talk to you anymore. 
And the worst one is the “number”. I’m terrified of having sex because my number will go up and then it doesn’t work out, forcing me to have to sleep with someone else in the future and have it go up EVEN MORE. 

I want to change my view on sex. I want to love sex like a normal person and see it as a positive thing, something to make you closer with a potential partner. I don’t want to be afraid of what future men will think of my past. How do I change it?

687,I don't like what I'm doing and I don't know what to do about it.,"Right now I'm a college sophomore working on a dual degree in math and computer science at a big expensive school a few states away from my home. I feel so bad talking to anyone in my life about this because so many people have helped get me here and I really don't want them to be let down. Growing up I was always encouraged to do something with STEM, I was always in robotics or science clubs in my school and everyone seemed to be yelling from all directions ""do something with computers, it'll get you money/a good job/happiness."" So I chose computer science, and was bummed that I wouldn't get to take the math classes I had worked so hard to reach, so I decided to double up with a math degree.

The thing is, I hate computer science. I have ADHD and the thought of getting a job where I sit at a desk coding all day is my biggest fear. I like teaching, and my current job is a T.A for some math courses and I love it, so I tell everyone I'm thinking about being a teacher, but the common response I get is ""that's a good backup for whatever you really want to do"" which sucks because now it feels like the only thing I want to do in that field will only ever be seen as a backup/failure of my potential. Don't get me wrong, I think teaching would be a great life, but it's still hard to justify being so far away at an expensive school to ""just be a teacher"" in my family's eyes.

On top of all that, even if I could live a great and fulfilling life as a teacher later down the road, I'm still miserable in this ""one for me one for them"" degree situation. I don't give a fuck about computer science and I don't think I ever will. I know it's great, I know it's a cash cow, but good lord if I have to dedicate another weekend to finishing a CS project instead of focusing on what I really want to do I'm going to lose it.

It's getting to the point where I just feel like I'm on constant damage control, I'm not studying these things because I like them, but because I hate them the least of all my perceived options. I don't even know where to begin figuring out what I want to do. The happiest time in my life was banging and drilling metal together for robotics in high school, but that's hardly engineering and I'm not going to pretend, like everyone else, that getting stoned and mangling a robot together means I would enjoy working as an engineer.

I've sat on this for two years now and I just don't even know where to begin. Sorry to all the CS majors out there, I respect your work and will always be impressed by it, it's just not my jazz.

The advice I'm looking for is less about my specific college situation and more abstractly: How can I find what I want to do? How can I move forward and dig myself out of this weird hole of non-interests?

Thanks for taking the time to read this, you'll know this means a lot to me because I'm tearing up just trying to get this all out... I don't know what to do",1
484,I Hate My Job But Have No Direction On Where Else To Go,"So I currently work retail at a major cell phone provider. I absolutely hate it. The people, the management, the direction of the company as a whole. I really want out as I've been doing it for over 3 years. I never had any intention to work retail but a startup I worked at went under, so I had no choice. Now, I have no idea what to do next. 

I just graduated with a masters in information systems, but I still have no idea what I want to do with it. People have told me to get certifications, but they are expensive as hell and I have no idea what direction to go in so I feel like I'd be wasting my time getting one if I never use it.

I feel like I have no direction in life and I have no friends to help out. I'm in a different state than family except for my wife.

If anyone has any advice on what they did if they were ever in a similar situation or just what to do to help get my mind fixed on what type of job to go towards. I feel so lost.",1
838,I want to get used to my worst trigger,"This is extremely hard for me to write. It’s literally hard for me to write the name of it. I’m shaking and I feel awful. I lost all of my memories, I don’t remember anything before age nine. I had a terrible childhood - I have a few very short memories like falling asleep or hiding from something, terrified - and I think maybe something happened and that’s why. My father was a very terrible person, but my family said they didn’t know of anything major that happened, and nobody smoked weed (my trigger. The smell. The word. The thought. The look. The existence of it.) that I knew as a kid either. 

 This is destroying my life. I can’t go outside because everybody in my state uses it. The bus ride home is terrifying and everybody just thinks I’m insane because I shake and sometimes cry and hyperventilate as soon as I smell it. I have dreams where it’s nothing but that and I wake up drenched in sweat. I smell it or think of it and I’m absolutely terrified. I feel like my life is ending. I feel panicked. I’ve been in a lot of dangerous situations (when I was a freshman someone tried to kidnap me) but I never feel fear during them, my mind switches to “GO! DO IT” and I feel like I can do anything and I will get out of it. 

But with this it’s just. It’s terrible. I’ve never felt so afraid or panicked as I have with this. I have a lot of absences because I couldn’t stay in class if it smelled like it. On my way home I hold my breath past 2 houses so that I don’t get dizzy and nauseous and panicked. I’m so panicked I can’t even think. 

I just want it to change but nobody believes me. I don’t even get it. I don’t know why. I have nothing associated to it, like being hit or something like that. With a very specific brand of alcohol my dad drank if I smell it everything stops and I feel like I’ve died and I understand that I was beaten even though I don’t remember it - I feel it, I feel the emotions I can’t remember. 

But with this I just don’t know what to do. Exposure does not work, evidently. I understand realistically nobody who is high will kill me or anything and it doesn’t really calm me. (I’m ashamed to say it but if someone smokes it often I can’t be friends with them. It just. I know it won’t make someone do anything bad, but my body tells me “this person will kill you” and I think of them as scary and terrible despite what my brain knows is true. It’s too much for me)

I’m at the end of my rope here. I’m so scared and confused",1

111,I think someone is trying to hack me. What do I do?,"Recently over the past year there have been multiple instances where someone or some people have either tried to or succeeded in logging into multiple accounts of mine. Everytime I managed to either change the password or the attempt has been blocked, but recently it's been getting more suspicious.

The first instance was almost exactly a year ago on October 4th I got two emails from Epic Games saying that a PlayStation account (I don't have PlayStation) was linked and 2 Factor Authentication settings were changed. I didn't see this until the next day when I received tons of emails where everything was unlinked, including the PlayStation account. I changed my password, reset 2FA, and removed my billing information as soon as I saw those emails. The weird thing was that there were no charges to my PayPal or credit card, and whoever signed into my account basically undid their own work.

Nothing happened until May when I got an email saying someone logged into my old Twitch account from Beijing. I switched the password, contacted support, and all of that. Then just a few days later, there was another email saying there was another successful login from Delhi, India. Again, I changed my password and did the whole speil. I thought nothing of it mainly because it wasn't the account I actually use. But still I was worried.

Then on August 11th, a sign in attempt on my Google account was blocked, and the activity said that it was a request from France. 

On August 22nd there was a new login on my Instagram account in New York City, I never saw this email until an hour ago when I looked up all security alert emails, I think it was put in the trash, but I definitely didn't do it.

Then there have been the past few days. Which has been extremely worrying. Last Friday, October 11, there was a blocked sign in attempt from Pakistan. Then yesterday someone logged into my Snapchat account from an iPhone XS Max in Tampa, Florida. And today I was locked out of my Reddit account due to ""suspicious activity"" and when I checked my account activity, it says 4 hours ago there was a login at none other than a *special needs school* in my area. There were also a sign in from a company called LeaseWeb USA yesterday, but then when I went to check again a few minutes ago, it wasn't there anymore, but there was another one saying it was from a company called Amanah Tech. This one also said it was yesterday, but it wasn't on the list the first time I checked.

What do I do? I'm extra careful on the internet, I don't sign up on shady shit, I don't download anything from shady sources, and I sometimes use a VPN, but I really only disable it either when I'm using cell data or at my house. So I have no idea how this is happening nor why it is happening. Should I contact the police? The FBI? What should I do?",1

625,Am I a looser?,"(M-22) I've stopped going to school and recently quite my job because I wanna focus all my time a making art and practicing my skills. Problem is I'm still pretty amateur and dont have many connections, if any. Though I mention time I have a problem with procstination and following through on plans. If I did go back to school I'd have to take out student loans because I've found i cant work and go to school at the same time, I'd just end up over stressed. 

I'm still living with my parents in our small 2 bedroom apartment, they said I now longer have to pay rent for now but I still help with chores whenever i can.
And it seems I've driven my youngest brother (11)  to sleeping on the couch because I've complained in the past about his heavy snoring like an asshole. Hell even my first younger brother (19) has managed to find a girlfriend and move out with her before I have. 


I havent leaned to drive yet, even though I know its something I have no excuse to keep putting off and it would help my family alot.

I wanna get a job to support myself on my own and move out stop mooching off my family, but, I just dont want to confine myself in a box. Theres sp much I wanna do that getting a commercial art job might not grant me. So if i wanna be an independent artist I've gotta be willing to be poor, and then staying with my parent almost sounds like a financial choice...even though it might just be an excuse.

And finally....I have a damn crush a professional erotic cosplayer whos not only significantly older then me, but from another country. And I've now got it in my head that I can some how try and close to her and get to know her. I'm even working on a few digital paintings that include her on occasions I saw her and tried to talk with her at an expo during the summer, occasions that didnt go they ways I had hoped...
Like that doesnt sound creepy off the bat. I never crossed a line and made her uncomfortable(least I hope so) but I know my behavior isn't something you want to be in. Especially since I'm hoping to sell my drawings at the same place next year and try again, this time not expecting anything from her. 

Thing is I can't seem to tell myself that the odds are impossible.
Hell love has come to people regardless of other circumstances. Why should I let these ego driven ideas about ""I'm not good enough for a chance at something"" stop me? And I wont lie maybe part of the reason I dont wanna settle for a commercial job is because i wanna impress her. Even though a younger guy still living with his parents and a near pubescent brother, with vague goals in mind, isn't the best look.

So yah...I'm kinda screwing myself over aren't I.

So my question is....how do I get myself going and out of this rut?
What's it gonna take to have the right mentality?
How do I make myself want to try, without having to make myself...if that makes any sense?",1

7,What do I do?,"I love my husband. I also love my dog. Most days we make a happy family and my husband and I hardly ever have conflicts like this. 

My dog is a two-year-old cocker spaniel who is well-trained, for the most part. He knows ""no"" and will listen when I tell him to leave something alone. However, the main issue he constantly has is that he doesn't understand personal boundaries. Or, rather, he doesn't know that when he jumps up, it can hurt. 

My husband had a tough relationship with my dog in the beginning. I had always wanted one and he finally relented. I paid for training classes for my dog and got them done and while we did have a problem with potty training for a bit, I finally invested in some bells for the door and that cleared everything up. I don't have any children so, really, it's like my dog is my kid. I do spoil him but he's very well behaved other than the boundaries issue. He's laid back and LOVES to be pet. During an argument we had a year ago, my husband confided that he thought that I loved the dog more than him. I told him that I didn't know why he felt this way but that I would give our dog to someone else if he felt like our dog was coming in between us. He stated that he wouldn't make me do that but that he did feel like I gave the dog more attention. Since then, I really have been working on that issue and it seemed like everything was going well. In fact, since we have moved to a new city, my dog and my husband have been spending more time together and my dog has taken to liking him even better than me! He goes into a FRENZY when his dad gets home compared to the tail  wags I get when I get home. I'm typically the disciplinarian and the one who gives him the ear meds that he hates so I figure that plays into the switch. It doesn't bother me AT ALL because I'm happy with the fact that they are getting along better than ever! 

That brings me to the issue that came up yesterday. We were laying down on the couch watching TV and my dog decided that he wanted to be with us, too. We usually are fine with letting him on the couch but this time he decided to jump on top of my husband who didn't have a shirt on and happened to scratch him in the process. My husband then proceeded to grab our dog and throw him to the floor. From my point of view, it seemed pretty forceful and it could have really hurt our dog. I get that it could have been a reaction from being hurt but it could have been handled differently. My husband then proceeded to get up and go play video games and went on like nothing. Later, I let him know that I was really disappointed in how he handled the situation but he just shrugged and said ""Well, he hurt me."" I told him that it scared me and that it really wasn't fair to punish him that way since we let him up on the couch all the time and our dog really just wanted to be loved on by him. *Not to mention that sometimes my husband lets him up and lets him lay on top of him while he pets him.* My husband knew that I was upset and decided to sleep on the couch last night. I'm confused as to how to handle the situation. Is it something that I blew out of proportion? Do we need to call in a professional trainer about the couch jumping and stop encouraging it all together? I'm open to all ideas and if someone has a great training tip for things like this, I'm all ears.",1

As time went on, we slowly started to become more busy with our own lives. However, I was very persistent with trying to call or talk to her whenever I got the chance.

I(23m) feel guilty for not feeling infatuated with her(23f)
u/lolrep201918m
I and my girlfriend are toghether for about 7 months.She it's the perfect girl for me,we have same hobbies,we think in the same way,we have our jokes,damn,I want to be with this girl as long as I can.

But I often feel very guilty and sad because I never felt that ""high"",that infatuation for her.In the past I had those emotions for other girls,but it was just from my side,so I didn't progressed with them.

When I started to date this girl I must say that I wasn't attracted to her physically,but over time,after speaking and spending more time with her I began to consider her very cute and I must say that I consider her gestures very adorable now.I like to hug her,to laught with her,I think that we have great chemistry.But the tought that I don't love her because I never felt that euphoria keeps appearing and it makes me sad,because I want to be with this girl.

I have moments when I can say that I really feel emotions for her and I love her,but I feel a little different about her in comparison with the past.The emotion towards her aren't obsessive,I feel some warm inside if that makes sense.

She knows about this problem,because I discussed with her,and over time we came to the conclusion that love isn't just that infatuation.

I searched on internet about this problems and I read that the infatuation period isn't lasting forever,so I'm okay then?

In conclusion,it's possible to genuine love someone even if you hasn't been infatuated with that person and emotions aren't constant?

544,My life is a mess and I've got major life decisions to make and I'm not sure what to do.,"Question: Should I drop out of college, and what path should I take if I do?

Context: I am enrolled as an engineering undecided student at university. I took pre-eng at a tech high school and I loved it. But I know it wasn't a realistic look at what I would be doing after college. I pretty much liked messing around with 3d software and using the machine shop in the back. But my dream was always going through, getting a major in mechanical technology and a minor in robotics and building autonomous systems like they do in the company Boston Dynamics.

But engineering requires a lot of math credits. And I have a processing disorder making any class difficult. Calculus especially. To elaborate for those who might know about mental disabilities, I have a processing speed of 100, which is average, but with an IQ of 134. Meaning I'm smart enough to be the golden child of my family and understand complex problems. But slow enough that I have no goddam clue how to do any math concept until it is explained to me five times by twenty separate people. And then when I now know the concepts in and outs, the homework takes my three to four times as long as anyone else.

This all is resulting in being only halfway through a semester and I'm not sure if it's actually possible for me to pass some of my classes even if I got A's on everything going forward.

Options: While I'm open to any suggestions I have thought about what I could do. I thought joining the Navy could allow me to pick up some specialized skills. Or I could go to some technical school with something more hands-on that I already have experience with like welding or a technician of some kind.

86,I told my ex’s parents he was threatening me,"I need some advice on a situation I won’t fully explain again, I already made a post about it in a different sub. The basics are that I had a pretty miserable relationship with my ex and he left me. After five months of me being no contact, he started texting me again, begging me to talk to him. I didn’t want to talk to him after everything he did to me, knowing he wanted to talk to clear his own conscience and not because he actually cares about me.

I ignored all of these messages and he got angrier and angrier. He’s also been developing an alcohol problem. On Friday night, he started threatening me. Saying I ruined his life and he’s gonna break me. Say things about me. Beat me up. 

He was drunk but I still sent screenshots of the texts to his sister and soon received a call from his mother asking to explain the situation. I told his family for the sake of my safety and so they knew how off the rails he is getting, threatening his ex who HE dumped.

Now, I’m starting to feel a lot of anxiety about this situation. His parents don’t seem to have much of a grip on him, and I’m afraid that he’ll want to take revenge on me for telling them even more.

Last night, as I was changing the song on my husband's phone I noticed the name of an old fling of his, on his notifications (from instagram). I confronted him about it and asked why he had not deleted/blocked her on social media, as we had discussed we would do with all of our old flings (we also had a previous arguement a few months back about why he had NOT deleted her on Facebook, after we said we would). He did not have a good reason for not deleting or blocking her. Basically, his go-to defense was he barely uses any social media other than Facebook, so he told me he didn't think to delete/block her on Instagram, and as to why he responded to her? He was being civil. So, as I was getting heated by his b.s. go-to answers I got his phone and went to check the messages. He had deleted messages, as the beginning of the conversation was him telling her to keep him updated on her tattoo. He then sent another message  about how gorgeous the state we live in now is, when he would be back to our home state, and sent her a picture of the beach we were just at 2 hours before. She responded with something along the lines of, how cool! How are you and the wife? (Which was the message I saw on his notifications).


I was (and still am) livid. In my eyes, he deleted messages, sent her a picture of the beach we were JUST AT, told her he would be back in town next month, and the fact that she asked about me (she was trying very hard to get in his pants when we were dating on/off, before we were married, and threw herself at him -- he enabled her behavior) pisses me off. 


I cursed him out last night, he apologized profusely, and I left the house. We've spoken this morning and he's apologized multiple times. But I'm sick of having to have arguments about why he hasn't deleted his old flings on social media (this is the third time we've had to have this talk-- but never to this extent) and his defense being ""I didn't think to block her here! Or here!! I don't use social media!!"" I asked him why he responded to her, he said he's being civil. I asked why he deleted messages, he said because he didn't even want to think about her or talk to her. So I ask then why did you even respond to her?? His response, ""i dont have anyone to talk to, I dont have a lot of friends!"" (Also b.s., as he has a friend that's staying with us for the weekend, and I, who has no friends in this new state, have not reached out to any old flings). So I ask why did you send her a picture of the beach we were just at?? ""Well, *big sigh of disappointment * before we married, she asked me to send her pictures of where we were going, and I thought she would love the picture I took of the beach"".

I had a guy that was trying to get into my pants while my now-husband and I were dating on/off (who my husband is completely well aware of), but I cut him off.  I used this as an example to my husband, if roles were reversed, he would be more livid than me. He completely agreed.


So what I need advice on is, what do I do now? Am I crazy to be mad?? Am I overreacting??

I was thinking of just ignoring him for the next week or so, or at least until his parents come to visit this next weekend and I'll act normal and once they leave just ignore him until he comes up with a non b.s. excuse.

I was also considering staying with a friend a few hours up, my husband has never never met him and might be suspicious that I'd fuck him, which I would never do. But I just don't know what to do. My blood is boiling.

TLDR;Husband talked to old fling when she should have been deleted/blocked, deleted messages, says he was just being civil with her. Has apologized profusely, but only has shitty excuses. He would be 10x more pissed had I done this. Now I'm lost, what do I do?",1
780,Issues with intimacy in theatre hitting close to real life,"   So this may seem a bit strange, but bear with me. Im a 21 yr old student at college who works as a theatre actor, but recently i got a role in a play that might as well be a modern rendition of sex in the city. This is a character that is supposed to be this sexually outgoing alt-rock dude (making out on stage, stories of hooking up with his wife in public not on stage, etc) and due to my large inhibitions with anything sexual i feel i will make it flat. I dont feel as if i can actually connect with the other actor on stage, as the idea of cuddling on a park bench and making out makes me feel really in my head. This relatively minor issue along with the message of the show has been pouring into my head more and more, and ive been feeling slightly depressed about it all. While the role itself is minor, the idea that my inhibitions are holding me back from being a decent actor or active participant in the play is messing with me mentally. 

  To make matters worse, its brought up a pretty bad memory of me getting molested when i was younger by getting forced into something twice by two other people and ive been confronting that as possibly the cause for me having these intimacy issues. Inn doing so things have been starting to make sense in my head about why i act the way i do around anything slightly intimate. i basically clam up and never take the initiative or try to move forward in anything as i dont want it to force someone outside there comfort level at all.  In terms of past stories, Ive told a girl i really liked ""what are you doing"" when she put her head on my shoulder, I didnt take initiative in holding my ex's hand or being the one to start kissing so i got to hear that from her friends making jokes because she had to make the moves on me, and ive also had a girl i was very interested in pull her pants down in front of me and basically present herself but i involuntarily walked away for god knows what reason. 

  Now im a virgin (surprising i know) and have had one real girlfriend with no sexual interactions, but id like to say im an attractive guy with a eccentric sense of humor, and generally have a good life outside of the thoughts of relationships. Never really heard a bad thing get said about me and my friends all seem to love having me around, but the thought that past experiences has been causing me issues getting close to another person is worrying me. I dont know exactly where to go in terms of tearing these walls i have down, and im just looking for direction on it all. Ive considered tinder for a fling, but even though i get a decent amount of swipes, im very much more of a personality in person than over text, where im might as well be dry as the desert. I also think it would possibly work if i could have a friends with benefits situation where im comfortable around a friend in a no judgement zone and can break down my sexual boundaries by repeated contact, but wouldnt know how to start with any of that as while im flirty, the second things get sexual in conversation i clam up. I just want to be able to move forward in my relationships without feeling like im just going to hit a wall.

Thanks for any help provided and reading.


TLDR: Play im in brought up issues with personal intimacy that bled into my day to day, and is now making me self conscious about my past, profession choice, and why i involuntarily push people away when things turn sexual. Just want help from others to give me options to break down these boundaries.",1

841,NYC restaurant job,"I’m trying to find a restaurant job in nyc but I’m having a hard time. I’ve gotten interviews and trial shifts galore from walking in and handing my resume to managers as well as Craigslist ads and Harri app and have applied for many many things.  I feel like I’m doing a decent to great job at these trials and interviews, so I’m not sure why nothing is surfacing in a job. I have experience, a nice looking resume, am a young female, make myself look as attractive as possible, etc. and I’ve been told I’m charismatic and well-spoken. Maybe it’s my experience? I only have a few months-worth in my Queens neighborhood, but I’ve learned a lot and can do everything, including serving and bartending. I’ve gone for every type of restaurant so it’s not like I’m only aiming for fine dining/fancy things. I think maybe I’m just not going about it the right way? Also why is it that when people say “we’ll call you”, even if they seem GENUINELY interested, I never hear from them again? What are some tips to avoid wasting my time and looking in the right places?",1
358,Was my therapist being weird?,"Hi,

So I (25 F) started seeing a new therapist for the first time today, for help with OCD and anxiety. I've only ever seen female therapists before, and they've always given me a form to fill in, spoke about confidentiality, etc. He (not sure what age he is, I'd guess in his 40s), didn't do any of that, we just started talking straight away.

He said a few things that struck me as odd, but I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it - the whole session was just somehow intense and he spoke in a way that didn't seem totally professional. In the course of the hour he:

&amp;#x200B;

Said he thought my initial email was “sweet”

Summarised that i was a “good girl” in high school

Said if you’re ""fucked up"" you shouldn’t become a therapist

Referred to other therapists as “nutjobs”

Said I came across as “fascinating, colourful, textured, multi-dimensional” - said it was an “intoxicating mix” like a diamond ring with so many colours (wtf)

Said he is going to say things to challenge me.

Oh, he also joked about a ruler that lay on the table, saying he uses it on his ""difficult clients"" (I know this is obviously a joke but still seemed a strange thing to say.)

Just interested to hear other opinions on this. I know he's definitely legit and accredited. I just don't know how comfortable I feel with the stuff he said.",1
557,i (M19) seriously resent my boyfriend (M18) and i can’t ignore it anymore,"when my boyfriend and i started dating he was a pretty shitty person. he was going through some stuff, but swore up and down he was there for our relationship at the time.

he would barely acknowledge me, seemed so annoyed with my being around him genuinely, would lash out at me for questioning him, was kinda manipulative and just in general a cold and awful person. but i liked him a lot so at the time i dealt with it and wanted to believe everything was fine, or my fault even. 

i genuinely was talking to my friends about how he might be a sociopath because he didn’t seem to show genuine empathy or care sometimes, and i stalked through his entire social media trying to find an example of him caring about another person. it was a bad toxic relationship. 

i have countless posts, notes and journal entries from the time talking about things that would happen where i blamed myself for it and my self esteem was shredded. he would ignore me and avoid me for days at a time and i thought it was my fault for being annoying. i would send him a text longer than a sentence and he’d never respond and i thought it was because i was annoying. he’d never want to touch me so much as to hold hands and i just thought it’s because i was disgusting and he was ashamed to be around me. it’s so funny how fast your sense of self-worth can fall when you love someone. yet he’d promise that he’d just had a bad day, or was being distant, or that i was making it all up in my head. just “play the victim stuff”

anyways, he broke up with me after not too long, i was heartbroken. absolutely heartbroken. and it didn’t stop there. one day he was posting on his instagram about how he can’t imagine being attracted to boys anymore because girls are so much hotter.. etc etc, and my friends all talked to me wondering if something had happened between us for him to do that, or they just felt sorry for me that he turned out to be straight after all. i messaged him and said that him posting stuff like that was insensitive because we hadn’t broken up that long ago and everything was still fresh. pretty much he immediately went to his friends and tell them that id expected us to get back together, couldn’t let go, was clingy and all the likes. and it wouldn’t have felt SO awful if it wasn’t for them all being at my very small school, friends with all my friends and kinda everywhere that i went. it all got around to an extent and it was humiliating to have so many people suddenly think so low of me, that i was the “crazy ex” for no reason other than me having told him something he did hurt me, it felt like like pure senseless betrayal. i guess i mention it as it goes in to say that he was pretty heartless and awful.

but then something changed. once i’d moved on and life had kept going, stuff he was going through in his life cleared up, and he just kinda changed. he was suddenly very eager to be friends, like close friends. it still hurt because i’d liked him but i tried to push through it. he went out of his way to go to my shows, give me gifts, found any excuse to hug me or play around. and all of my friends told me he still had feelings for me, like really strong feelings and would go to them all the time upset that he’d ruined it all. it was a sweet moment, i found out, ran to him, he kissed me, apologized, and we agreed we were going to try again and really make it work.

it’s honestly been amazing. over a year together since and i don’t even recognize him. honestly he’s probably a better person than me and he makes me a better person everyday. our dynamic is completely equal, we’re great at communication, he’s my best friend and partner in crime. it’s everything i could ask for but it’s all i can do to look back at everything and how shitty it was. how awful i felt, how low my self esteem was, i just need him to see and understand what i went through. he never had had to and from the moments our conversation has touched on moments during that time, he genuinely doesn’t seem to understand the extend of it. all those memories are good memories or just memories to him but all i remember are the times he yelled at me, or scolded me in front of all of our friends for leaning against him and making his arm fall asleep, or cancelled our dates, or refused to let anyone see that we were together. it’s like he doesn’t even remember that part of it.

from the outside looking back at how much i accepted and how little self-respect i had, i get so mad. it’s like i wish i’d stood up for myself and broke up with him and cut him off and not tolerated anything, but if i’d have done that we probably wouldn’t be dating now. if i could talk to the person he was about everything, cuss him out, scream, yell, show him how i feel and make him understand the pain he caused. i would make sure he saw repercussions for how shitty and soul-less he was and was treating people. but now that person is my sweet sweet boyfriend and i am starting to not be able to compartmentalize the two anymore.

i just got done telling him all this, showing him the journals and posts and notes, speaking up about things i haven’t let myself talk about, and in as level a head as possible made sure he could see. this has all built up inside be for a year and now it’s out and i can’t just ignore it. the thought of him makes me so mad and the fact that he’ll never have to pay the price or deal with repercussions or ever truly understand is one of the worst parts. i don’t know what to do now that this is in the open. i don’t know how to deal with it.

tl;dr: my boyfriend was emotionally abusive when we started dating, and even though time and growth and change has happened, i can’t ignore that it happened. it’s making me resent him and messing up our relationship. how do i handle this???",1
391,My fiance's ex-friend is giving him trouble. Help!

He doesn't want me to yell at or message her back but she keeps bugging me. She wants him to send it back to her but it was a freaking gift and I don't think just because he had a falling out with her that he should give it back.

649,My [40F] son [14M] is getting bullied and his school is doing nothing about it. I don't know what to do?,"My son just started high school, and he has been dealing with a few bullies. He says they call him names, push him into lockers, throw things at him, etc. I've informed his teachers and the principal about the bullying, and they've done nothing. My son tells me that the teachers don't do anything about it. It's as if they don't care.

My son has been dealing with the bullying for three years now. We were hoping that since he was out of junior high and going to a new high school, he would have a fresh start. But the bullying is occurring again. When he was in middle school and he was being bullied, I once again addressed it to his teachers and principal, and they have done nothing.

I am tired of the school brushing this off. My son is suffering and he is starting to become reluctant to go to school.

My son is very sweet. However, he is pretty quiet. He's a loner. He's not a fighter.

What can I do to stop the bullying problem that my son has been dealing with for years?",1
5348,My new employee is a psychopath...

This mans 28 and he comes across as a really nice guy but he’s been on and off and allways turns up late but again I have let it slip as he’s a “nice guy” anyway today we sat down for lunch and he continued to tell me that he needs the day off on the 22nd for a court date, so intrigued I asked him “what did you do?” He then told me so relaxed that he got caught up in some drug related shit and that he and a few other accomplices kidnapped and tied someone up and removed there toes and gave him a good beating and basically tortured this guy. Also to add to this he’s got a warrant out for his arrest, now I don’t judge at all and believe in giving people a chance but really what am I supposed to do in a situation like this haha?",0

549,Im 21 and my parents are getting divorced.,"I cant say i didnt see it coming, but i always thought my mom would have done it.

Im in college right now and live with my parents in the house i grew up in. Im also on their health and auto insurance and im afraid my father wont love me enough to keep me on the insurance. 

The reason for my fear is because my father makes me pay for things that he doesnt make my sister pay for. He was willing to give his newer model car to my sister and leave me with a 2005 model car. He accused me of not paying for my own food, clothes, and gas which isnt true. Its obvious he prefers my sister over me. I know i was a pretty crappy child when i was young and that i was hard to handle but that doesnt make it okay for him to make me pay for it now. 

My mom gets paid significantly less than my dad and he doesnt want to keep the house. We live in Colorado which is pretty expensive to live in as it is too which is why i havent moved out yet, and because i dont feel like im ready to move out on my own yet. 

My dad has depression and lately he's been making decisions without thinking them through such as dropping two grand on a dog when he could have gotten a much less rude one at a shelter for much cheaper. He took out a loan from his retirement to buy a tv we didnt need. And most recently he decided to buy equipment to grow weed without doing any research. He planned on selling it to a coworker and wasnt going to lock it up even though by law he had to because he had at the time to minors in the house. 

He isnt treating my mom great. He went from telling her ""i love you"" one day then asking for a divorce the next. He is ignoring her and took of his wedding ring. He wont even entertain couple's counseling and i dont even know how much he's thought this through because counseling would have been much cheaper in the long run. 

What does my mom need to do so she doesnt get screwed over my my dad? What do I need to do so i can stay on my dad's health insurance until im 25? What do i need to do to protect myself and my own interests in this whole thing? The last thing i want to do is drop out of college in order to survive but i fear that i might end up having to.",1

So I'm an 18 year old girl and I struggled with this for a couple of years now. My problem is that I'm extremely concerned about people thinking I'm ugly. Every day I feel the urge to look in the mirror for a really long time and I don't mean in a way that normal people do but I have to view myself from every angle and distance....So I dinstance myself from the mirror to see what I look like from far away then I get really close. Then I have to view my profile,.....(You get the idea...)
That just really sucks and all this overthinking takes up a lot of time every day. I just want to not give a sh*t about my looks for once and I try everyday to not care but it never works... I don't have a lot of friends because I'm very shy as well and that's all because I keep comparing myself to every single girl that walks past me. And that makes me feel so bad because most of them are waaay prettier than me.
I hope you can give me some advice on how to just accept that I'm ugly and stop caring already...
And pleaase don't wrtite stuff like everyone is beautiful because I don't think telling myself I'm pretty and lying to myself is going to help.",1

621,Niece is on a downward spiral,"I'm 22 years old &amp; my niece is 11 (who I'll call Jane), because we are closer in age &amp; have A LOT in common,  she loves me to death &amp; talks with me on a daily basis. I recently found out she had been molested since she was 5 or 6, has come out as a lesbian, &amp;  talks about really dark topics in a casual way. I'm worried about how her father is handling her mental health &amp; he is grateful I am talking to Jane &amp; giving her advice. But I feel as if he isn't doing enough to be there for her (I'm not a parent, bu I know too well what it's like for Jane in this situation), the dad has custody of her &amp; Jane lives with him, but she doesn't talk to him because he said 'people will think you're crazy &amp; send you to a mental ward'.

I truly believe her dad wants to help, but doesn't know how to since Jane is his only daughter (as am I, so I know how she feels). I'm literally the only person she can talk openly to about how she feels. I encouraged her to try &amp; talk to her father because he'll never know how to help if he doesn't know &amp; I even texted him asking to try to be understanding towards her &amp; NOT scare her out of getting help. She actually did talk to her after I made her promise to at least try &amp; I was happy everything went well.  Unfortunately,Jane hasn't seen her therapist in over a month or 2 &amp; I hope she makes it to the one tomorrow; she told me her stepmom (who is just 3 years older than me)  will either cancel the appointments or forget them (making Jane even angrier &amp; upset).

Jane has a lot of emotional issues &amp; mental health issues that are stemming from a lot of places &amp; I don't know how to help her besides being basically her 2nd therapist. I don't know if it's my place to tell her father or stepmom what to do, but I feel as if they either aren't making time for her &amp; her health or are genuinely confused on how to help Jane.

**TL DR: My niece has a lot of mental health issues &amp; I don't think her parents are doing enough to help her. Is there anything I can do to help her?**

I told her we shouldn't be friends anymore. But she isn't ready to leave me. We were really close but after she got a boyfriend she didn't give a fuck about me. Now she says she is losing interest in him. She tried to hug me and I avoided because I really miss her.

389,"I received a text from an ex friend of mine, we fell out and haven’t spoken in months ever since she blocked me, until she texted me from a different number on a Friday night saying she missed me, but I had a suspicion it was someone pretending to be her. I’m not sure how to tell if it was real.","She texted me saying things like she missed me and if I would want to get with her again (when we were never together) and sent emojis and kisses that was very unlike her. She could’ve been drunk but I’m not sure if I’m being too paranoid, it didn’t seem like her and when I asked her to tell me something only we would know she proceeded to just tell me things that have text evidence so anyone could’ve hacked her or my phone to see those messages and pretend to be her. My suspicion is that it could be a hacker who has gained access to our WhatsApp chats. She requested for us to meet which I definitely wasn’t going to fall for and when I demanded convincing proof that it was actually her, she backed away claiming that I clearly didn’t want to speak and said bye and blocked me; maybe i spooked whoever was pretending to be her?

I have the number and have screenshots of the messages incase but is there anything I can do with the number to legitimise it? I got as far as seeing that it was the same provider as her last number so I’m hopeful. It’s best to add that I would hope it was her because I’d really like to be close with her again.
I’m thinking of going to her house to ask her in person, I don’t trust any digital interaction with her right now.

Edit: I can’t be certain but I’m sure she was using an old photo of herself on WhatsApp and I have checked whether the number is linked with any social media and it’s not, she has social media and if she changed her number it would’ve linked to it.",1

414,How does it feel to have a mom and dad?,"Ive a 16 year old guy and I’ve always been raised by my grandparents, my grandpa died 3 years ago but I never really considered him a father figure because he was my grandpa and that’s how I thought of him. My grandma thinks my sister and I are a burden, she hasn’t said it directly but I asked her and she didn’t say anything and told me to shut up. She’s 53 and retired. Our biological mom smokes weed every day and had me at 17 and my sister at 19, my sister and I have different dads but even tho we live with our grandma he still does everything for her. My biological father was in prison most of my life and I never got a letter. He got out 3 years ago but I really don’t want anything to do with him because I don’t feel that connecting. I also tend to act more feminine and I think this is contributing to the fact that I never had a father. So how does it feel to have a dad. People think  I’m gay but I’m not due to me acting more feminine. I’ve suffered some major depression through my life because of this that I try to bring to the attention of my family but they’ve never listened, just criticized.

5292,Did the doctor turn my cat gay?,"Well the next day he was acting strange, he has always been an independent cat, rarely coming around, never wanting to be held, but as I sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg. He then went and jumped up on the table where we’d done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until I decided I guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment. This time he didn’t fight me though, and when I inserted the tube he closed his eyes, stretched his neck, and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy. Maybe the medicine made him feel better, I supposed. That night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me, which he had never done before. For the next week he’d do the same thing every day, meow on the table until he got his ‘fix’... But then the medicine ran out. Even though I had no medicine he’d still cry and beg for it, I thought maybe if I insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn’t make him feel better anymore and forget about it. Well that was 2 weeks ago and he is only getting worse. He walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me. He is demanding insertions more and more often. Yesterday I caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster... When I sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately. It was then in horror I realized my cat thinks I’m his gay lover, and that I’ve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now. Needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable. How do I let my cat know that I’m not gay, but still like him as a friend?",0

561,I don't get along with my sister,"I (20) and my sister (23), don't get along. I don't hate her, but I also don't like her. Today someone asked me "" what's your best childhood memory w/ your sister?"" and I actually couldn't think of one. I remember nothing good that's happened thanks to my sister, just bad. 

this guy also asked me what my sister has done to me that I force my brain into blocking out memories that I've made with my sister but I didn't really have an answer for that either...

I'm on here not because of me but because of my mom, you see im very open about disliking my sister, everyone knows that I don't like her and I even tell her ""I just don't like you"" and this is beginning to hurt my mom because she thinks that when she passes away that I will not keep in touch with my only sister, and in a way she might be right.

heres how I'd describe my sister if you asked me... she's annoying, she's very dependent of my parents (mostly my mom), she doesn't know how to cook, she's book smart but not street smart, she's a snitch, she still cries for everything (its not bad to be emotional), she is most certainly bipolar, she's very nosy, talkative, she kisses ass to anyone above her, anddddddd I think that's a pretty accurate description in my point of view...

842,Energy drinks and alcohol problem,"So energy drinks and alcohol mixed is fucking stupid and I never recommend it to anyone because it can fuck your brain up in a lot of ways, for me it was only for a few days but I’m not sure if it can get worse or better for others.
But basically I had quite a few energy drinks before drinking and I also mixed some with my alcohol and tried it. Before I did this I checked to see if it was dangerous and there were quite a few studies that suggested it would fuck with your brain with shit like suicidal thoughts but I thought nothing of it because I just assumed it would be fine. Anyway I had a great time at first but as the night went on i started thinking about stuff and how everything was just gonna go wrong and so on. I tried hiding it because I was with a group of friends and didn’t wanna kill the mood but over the next few days the effect didn’t seem to fade so out of worry that something bad would happen I broke up with my girlfriend at the time to protect her and not have that on her mind as much I guess. This was months ago and I still care about her a lot and at the time I didn’t give her a proper excuse. I want to tell her about it because she deserved a reason but I also feel like it’ll seem like some poor attempt at getting her back. What I’m basically asking is do I tell her or leave it and let her get on with her life?",1

180,"Flatmates are pigs, how do I make them change?","http://imgur.com/gallery/KsX3neN

Due to my current situation, I am unable to move out and therefore have to deal with living with these people. 

10 months ago, I moved in with my boyfriends siblings (we rented our own home) so we could all save on cash. When they threw their house in and moved in to ours till we found a home, they were always messy and disrespectful about the way they wanted my house to look (changing my house around, changing it again when I changed it back) I didn't want to ruin my relationship with them so I tried to just swallow my pride and let them be. When we moved in to our new home together, I set up the bottom floor and went to my room, 2hrs later everything was changed and the house was messy. I said to myself ""Okay, whatever, I'll just clean and hopefully they'll get the message"" they never did. For 2 months straight I was cleaning and picking up after them, while the older woman in the house would occasionally do washing and cook. I decided I had enough and started telling them they had to clean their mess. They never listened so I just left it. After a while I got fed up and took my dishes away because less dishes, less dishes to be left dirty. I put them in a cupboard I claimed (it was not in use) and wrote saying (you may use if you wash and put it back) The older woman and I had an argument, which was pretty much her saying ""This is my house, this is my family, this is not your place to be doing anything like that"" right, I called a meeting and made sure she knew it was not hers, but ours, and made it clear that the house had to be clean, since SO and I are the only one living on this floor, and its disgusting to be living in other peoples mess. It went well for a few weeks but went back to the same bs. I just decided to clean up after them and say nothing, live in my hatred till I can finally move out. But now, I've realised that I can not move since some financial issues have tied me to this place and I really need advice on what to do in this case.

For 10 months now I've dealt with this sh*t, and this is only the bottom floor. I cannot understand what makes them think this is okay. I am at my wits end with these people. They cannot take care of my things, they cannot take care of themselves, they do not respect anyone and cannot understand why I'm so upset. I've tried everything to make them change and nothing has changed at all. Seriously, I've tried just cleaning up after them, I've tried talking to them about it, I've tried leaving the mess (it'll just sit till I clean it) I've tried taking my things away (they do not respect my boundaries and use my stuff anyway) I've even tried showing them the pictures. Everything was not well received and I was blamed for being ""too clean"". I need some advice please, I can't take this anymore.",1

5287,Social cues,"I'm not the best at picking up on certain social cues. I'm not typically awkward, but I sometimes experience an internal conflict/panic when an interaction may call for a hug, handshake, high-five, wet willy, goose, ass slap, reach around, etc.

How am I supposed to know what the other person expects? I don't want to make things weird if I go in for a friendly grab-and-squeeze when they're just trying to greet me with a wave.

Do the rules change depending on your company? What if I'm at work or at a funeral? How do I greet my waitress? Do bellhops get fistbumps? Are finger guns and thumbs ups universally accepted? Can I chestbump females? How about titty twisters? How am I supposed to know if my actions are culturally appropriate or racially sensitive?

821,My break up story,"my gf \[18\] found out that I \[18\] have smoked weed two times without her knowing (I have only smoked 3 times in my life), this was my gf of 2 years and I soon planned to propose to this girl. Anyways she said that smoking behind her back, was a breach of trust (which i understand, and wanted to talk to her and move past it.) she  also compared it to cheating. she told me that she needed space and said that we are on a break. (which I took as taking time to think about stuff) To her a break means you are single. after a few days I finally told her that i either wanted to work things out or to see her in person so she could break up with me. so on Saturday we broke up. I was heart broken because a relationship of 2 years can end so easily with one mistake, but anyways I am depressed and crying when I remember her password she uses for most things.

&amp;#x200B;

now I know this is bad and I have no excuses for doing this but I logged into her snapchat, I looked at her msgs and I realized that on Friday the day before we officially broke up she went on a date with a 21 year old and fucked twice in his car. the msgs where with her cousin and they were enjoying themselves, she said stuff like ""yes girl you go its okay to be a hoe every once in a while"" and she said ""the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else"" now I understand if this was a little relationship that went south but we planned to get married and have kids we both talked about these things with such joy, so needless to say I am heart broken, I don't understand how someone that was in a 2 year relationship can just fuck someone else a few days after they fight without even breaking up officially. IDK what advice I am looking for but i am posting this anyways.",1
550,How do you casually date,"A brief explanation me 24(m) never really been in a relationship before, I have never been into dating before because I was to busy on other things.
 I think I'm a good looking guy, if a go to the bar or club  at least 2/5  times a girl approach to try to talk or dance with me or if I go talk to a girl i I'm interested in i dont get rejected instantly or even outsize if I approach a girl they always seems so invested on trying to know me at first at ivd been told a lot of times that I seems so confident and funny and the problem is and its Breaking me apart what's comes next... when  I start to talk to a girl they always want to meet but after a couple of dates they just changed completely, they stop replying as fast as they used or stop asking question as before or even stop hitting on me.

As for right now I dont want a relationship I just want something casual?

I'm in a situation that I met a girl 19(F), I noticed that she was super into me texting alot had a lot of fun she constantly tells me that she likes me but same after 2 months she started replying once a day, she still reply is nice as always and asking question. yesterday we got into a fight because I thought she was just not into me anymore and I told her that j was gotta back off, she got pissed saying that saying that she likes me alot but dont like all the pressure and that's when it hit me I've been told that A LOT OF TIMES before. I dont know what I'm doing to make the girls feel pressure I have met girl like this know that wants the same as me something casual but then tell me I'm putting to much pressure on them, I dont knows what I'm doing to make them feel like that.  I dont tell them that i love them or anything intense, I don't tell them that I wanna see them every day so I really don't know what I am right.
I think Its because I text them every day and reply too fast  and I try to make conversation and just say overall nice things. and I give the impression
so me question is How do you casually date? like what are the ground rules? should I text them once a week? should I text them just to hangout? should I just keep a simple conversation?  how often should I ask them to hang out?

Right now with this girl I'm so confused we want the same thing but I'm making her thing that I want something else or more serious.",1

355,I miss my friend and I need help,"Well, I don't know how to start this, but I hope they are very good.

I am currently distanced from a friend and former high school classmate who is really worth a lot to me. It all happened in a way that I never wanted.

I will try to be brief. We will call her by the imaginary name of Britany, and her ex-boyfriend, who was also my friend and former partner, we will call him Andy.

Some time ago I was going through a great crisis, which I dragged from the age of 15, was a simple child who was thrown out of school I was going to have disapproved of the year, leaving me adrift, away from my classmates, and without the possibility of A second chance to improve as a student. (And no, I am not trying to victimize myself, but I was really having a hard time, my parents were going through a separation, and the school saw my bad school performance so they sent me to a psychopedagogue who sent me a diagnosis which said that I was very attached to my friends and that I also had attention problems, and that mattered little to the school, who shit on my feelings).

But hey, back to the subject. Nor did my friends from before understand what I was going through, and I also had some error as a person (I failed them on occasion, I recognize it).

There came a time of the year 2018-19, which were in the last year of high school, were graduates and were going to make the trip of graduates. And I, simply here, drifting, living from suffering for not being able to be a part, and without them being able to know about my pain, while each time I noticed that they were moving further away.

Sometimes I saw them, and tried to talk to them, to get back together as we used to do, that we organized in some house to eat, or to go out to a club or night party.

I was friends with Britany for the entire time I was sharing a high school course, and beyond that, we went out until two years ago (even when I was dating Andy) to have beers out there, smoke, and have fun like two friends.

It turns out that some time later, for some reason, she got mad at me (it seems she got jealous because I uploaded a photo with an instagram

her friend with whom I was fighting) and I remember one night from her mouth to say that she didn't want to be friends with fake people.

Well, I let time pass, and it happened. One night, in a nightclub, she greeted me, I greeted her and I remember consulting her for her anger, which I think she didn't remember.

We had something, we smoked some cigarettes, and we talked for a while. There, I also found Andy and greeted him, I told him that I had to talk to him later, and when I found him again later, I told him that I longed to join him and we should have a drink and play videogames some day.

Well, the next day, I wrote a message to that friend to organize, a message he never saw, then later I wrote another one that didn't interest him either. I started to consider that he was angry with me.

Time passed and I didn't see her anymore. In the meantime, I think she was still offended, I don't remember precisely why, or if the photo I uploaded to instagram was after that night I saw her.

One of those nights, I dreamed about her, and I missed her so much that I was awake to wake up and write a message to whatsapp, which never came because I had broken the phone.

Then, I think that this weekend, walking around a nightclub, I saw her after a long time, she looked at me, I looked at her, and I gave her a hug that really was very restorative, I told her how much I missed her and longed for the old time. I told him to join us for a beer and walk in the park as we did before.

We did it, we fixed it, and I went to look for it one afternoon, I accompanied her to find out some things she needed to know near the square, we went to the supermarket to buy to drink, and we sat in the square.

Speaking a bit of everything, I bring up the subject of her ex-boyfriend (Andy), I tell him that he seemed offended with me and, quickly, she replies that he was angry because supposedly ""she was filling her friends with lies with things of the"". Well, he also told me that after being with me drinking beers, he would meet a friend of his ex-boyfriend that he liked.

Well, some days later, I went to a nightclub. And, over there, while I was having a drink, I feel my friend Andy calling me from behind, I turn in surprise, I greet him and say ""hey, I thought you were mad at me"" and I told him what Britany said (only the first thing , about what he was going to meet with a friend of him, no). And he said no, that nothing to do, and that with his ex-girlfriend everything was fine. So, I kept calm, talked a little more and went for a walk.

I went to a bar to ask for a drink, and over there, she comes to greet me, which I greet her well, and I told her that I had seen Andy and that he had told her what she told me and that he had said No, everything was great with her. Immediately, she was offended and angry.

I tried to approach her all night to explain everything well, but she didn't want to listen to me. I assumed I was a little drunk, so I assumed that maybe it was temporary anger and I shouldn't take it so seriously.

The next day, it was a great day, I go to Instagram and invite her to walk and drink wine, her response was something like ""with you I do not go to the corner"", followed by that, and trying to remedy her anger (but it seems that I made it worse) I replied ""you do your head"" (if you do not understand this expression, it is something like worrying too much about something that does not make much sense to worry), followed by that, I block Instagram and decided not to insist more .

Some nights, let's say 4 or 5, I've crossed it in the nightclub and try not to cross looks, and if I cross it I don't say hello, because at first I think it's not my fault, I just wanted to be fine with everyone, but I don't think she can apologize either, because she seems proud. But really, this is contrary to logic, because I would like to reconcile with it.

I hope you can help me. The situation is hurting a lot and I'm dreaming of her very often and miss some moments with her. I think there is too much to walk and I would not like to distance myself from it.",1

140,Broken Rejected Hurt Confused,"  

I am going to give everyone here a story please don’t judge. I don’t think I did anything wrong. But I guess that is why I am posting here to figure out what is going on in my life. 

Just to clarify I am going to give you guys two stories that should eventually merge. One is going to be about my friends and how I lost all of them the other is going to be about how I fell in love. 

So, let us start with my love story. I met this guy a year ago let us call him Joe. Joe and I met a year ago playing Pokémon go. I thought he was cute, so I got his number. He wasn’t very social at the time but eventually he told me he was straight so I let my interest in him fade. 

The holidays came and I was very demeaned by my family my cousin came over and told me I did not contribute anything to the family. I also got a D in a college class. I became very depressed and even had thoughts of suicide. 

I started going to therapy after winter break and told my therapist I could not feel anything anymore. I felt so hallow like everything was taken from me. At the time my best friend (let us call her Sue). Sue was very depressed and I listened to her all the time however she put me down a lot. I took her to the grocery store all the time but she did not seem to appreciate me at all. I felt so used but I was lonely so I thought it was better than nothing. 

Spring break came and I was still having suicidal thoughts. I was sad and angry so I had at least regained emotions. Joe then out of no where asked me to go to the movies with him to see an anime movie. I did not think anything of it at the time just friends. So we met at his apartment and he drove there and he had paid for the tickets. We had a nice time. I had so much fun. I did not feel used. I did not feel like I had to hide. We ended up hanging out the rest of the week everyday. We had dinner but paid separate. And I was regaining all my happiness again. I told him on the last day of spring break that I had been really depressed before he asked me out to the movies. And he had made me feel much better. I thanked him for a great week. 

Anyway Joe originally was not going to stay in my state for long he wanted to move back north with his family and friends. But he got a promotion at work and decided to get his masters here. He decided to buy a house. He had included me in buying his house he would show me every house and ask my opinion. His parents were very involved though and helped him pay for part of it. However, when he finally bought the house and was going inside for the first time he called me. I was curious as to why he called me. I asked if he had talked to his parents yet and he said “No, I wanted to call you first.” I kind of blushed a little and was confused. I brushed it aside at the time. Not sure why. Joe then got busy with his master’s degree so he did not have much time for me. I did not mind I knew he was busy. 

So summer came and he was really busy but I went out with my sister and played pokemon go. I met this older couple in their lower 50’s. They were very nice to me. I let them in my life and told them all my problems. They helped me at first. They let me go with them to a an anime festival. Joe also came. We hung out the whole festival together. I had so much fun. He was so nice to me. I told Joe I wanted to find the love of my life at the festival. But I had no luck until I realized towards the end of the festival I don’t think anyone could have made me happier. 

I then decide to make slight moves on Joe I rested my head on his shoulder once and he told me “I don’t think my shoulder is very comfortable” and I stopped he then said “I did not say you should stop though”. I became confused so then I went to a restaurant with the older couple and him. Afterwards I saw he had some ketchup left right on his cheek near his lips. I got my finger and without saying anything just wiped it off for him. He smiled and just stared at me while I did it. Our eyes looking into each other. Joe asked if I was touching unshaven hair on his face and I told him no there was left over ketchup. Joe is usually pretty reserved but afterwards he became very bubbly and talkative. But I was tired and got the older couple in my car and left. They then teased me how I was so flirty with him. But I blushed and said “No, it is just stuff friends do”. It was then I realized I don’t think we were treating each other like just friends. 

I called Joe the next week after that and he told me “I bought a new house and got a hamster and you haven’t visited me yet”. He nagged on me for a bit about how I didn’t come over enough. So we hung out that Sunday and watched football then went out to talk for a bit at a park. We then ate at chili’s and just hung out you know. So then later that week he needed a ride to the airport and needed me to pick him up. The times were early and late. So I asked to sleep over. He said sure (he originally thought at my place but he was just tired and I think he forgot he owned a house lol.) He then proceeded to ask me to go run some errands with him in a city about an hour away. So we went on the errands together. And when we went to dinner he paid for both of us. It was the first time he had done that. We ate and made small chit chat. Then we got home and I saw a pokemon I wanted at a park near his house. He then said “It sounds like you really want to go to the park.” So we went to the park together at like 10 at night. It was very calming and nice. So then we got back. And I sat super close to him I touched his feet with mine. My hand on top of his. I even patted his head but got no response. So I took him the airport the next day early. I asked him to send me pics and he did.

Anyway when he was gone he told me to watch this anime “Yuri on Ice” and I watched it. It was a gay anime I didn’t know that when I started it. But there was a lot of relations that I made to the anime and our relationship. Anyway by now I was so fallen for him. I picked him up for his trip and he made jokes and poked fun at me for picking him on the wrong level of the airport. He had gotten in a habit of poking at me a lot in a cute way. I took him home and asked to stay over for a bit even though it was late he let me. He started kissing his hamster mere inches from my face. I don’t know why. It was strange. So we were supposed to hang later on that week. But he got busy and he called me. He said he was busy the rest of the week and proceeded to say he was even busy on Sunday. It took me a bit of questioning to find out but he was going to go out with a girl to a bar to watch football. I don’t know why he didn’t just come out and tell me that. But I got jealous. I thought things were going good and now it seemed he was avoiding me and going out with a girl. I decided to try and move on. 

So I started hanging out with my Best friend Sue again. She made me try and join her fraternity which was open to all genders. Everyone was so nice to me. I felt so included and I started to let him go a bit. But then I got a call at 11pm from one of the members at around I had become super close with and I was told I was rejected. There was lots of laughter in the background.  I realized my friend had played me. They had played a game with me to make me feel included so they could hear my reaction when I was rejected. I questioned my friend and she said she didn’t know anything about it even though she had heard the phone call. So I ended up having to cut her off. When I cut her off I lost pieces of my heart. I felt so heart broken. I texted Joe and he was busy for a while but I poured my heart out to him. We had hung out the day I had gotten the call and he had warned me they might be hazing me. He texted me and told me I wasn’t a bother to him and that I had just made a dumb mistake to learn from. He said he didn’t have much time for me because he was sick and had work and his masters degree and was leaving for another trip. 

So now we are up to the events of this past week. I told Joe I just needed to spend time with him I was so lonely and broken. A group project for one of my classes had happened and nobody included me on purpose to leave me out even though they had my contact info. So Joe asked me to go out with him far away to run an errand. We drove about an hour and half. We had a great talk and he was so nice and listened to me. He was concerned about my mental and physical health. I told him I was scared of him distancing himself from me cause it felt like I was losing everyone. He assured me it was okay. We went to dinner and he paid. He made comments about how I had gotten the cheapest meal when I should have taken advantage of him paying. We drove back in a thunderstorm and he loved the rain. I did too. It was calming. 

We had planned on a sleepover the next day and hanging out on Saturday. But Friday he was so cold to me. He was tired. I hadn’t made any moves or flirted. But I made dinner for him and he was just quiet. I made breakfast for him the next day on Saturday. And I talked to him and shared personal things about me. He seemed concerned. So we went out with the older couple and Joe became very talkative with me again. Teasing me. But he made some more serious jokes this time. He joked about me not relying on others enough and keeping to myself. He also didn’t want to help me stretch my arm out he seemed to not want to touch me or anything. He pulled away when I tried to rest my head on his shoulder. It was weird he seemed angry at me though I hadn’t done anything. The older couple texted me later on and said I had been flirting too much with him. They did admit he seemed to be flirting back as well but they told me to stay away. I became so discouraged. So after we hung out with friends we drove back to his house. I knew he didn’t want me to stay late. So I left right away cause I was an emotional wreck. 

I went to my other best friends (his name is Ryan) house where he was having a party. He encouraged me to open up about my boy problems. There was lesbian couple there. One of them was super nice to me and wanted to hear my whole story so I told her and she gave me advice. We hung out most of the party and I had so much fun. Ryan though told me to stop talking about my problems and it was bothering people even though he was the one who even brought it up to begin with. So I had stopped and was just hanging with everyone. But then out of nowhere he asked me to leave. I saw the other lesbian girlfriend she was crying. Apparently she had gotten jealous I had been talking and hanging with her girlfriend so much. My friend told me I was selfish and overdramatic. So I left and the girlfriend asked me why I was leaving so early I just said I was tired. So then I lost another piece of my heart. My other best friend has been so mean. I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong the girlfriend and I had been laughing and enjoying each other’s company. 

I went home broken. I started crying and cried myself to sleep. I became so depressed I felt so rejected. So ostracized. I then decided to turn to my family. I wanted to spend time with them. I spent time with them and started feeling better. My mother then wanted to listen to a sermon for bible study. And the sermon talked about how emotions are evil and how homosexuality is just a sin to overcome. I knew then that even though I had never told her she knew what was going on. She purposefully had chosen that message to try and fix me. I left the house and drove far away. I cried in my car for two hours on the phone with a friend. My friend told me it seemed like Joe loved me back.

But I just don’t know anymore. I want to cut Joe off instead of facing rejection. I feel so rejected I don’t know if I can take anymore. My heart is mostly gone. Joe holds the last pieces. I would rather cut him off then have Joe take them from me. He is my first love. And I haven’t had the courage to tell him. I feel so scared. I am so hurt. I am so rejected. I have been going to therapy and it isn’t helping anymore. I am just lost. I don’t know what else I can do. Joe has already planned for me to take care of his house while he goes on a trip in December and Joe is taking me on a trip to San Antonio for my birthday in January. But I just cant take it anymore. I want to be alone now. Every bridge I worked to build has fallen apart on top of me. 

I constantly feel like I am choking under all this pressure. I hate love. I hate my friends for betraying me like they did. I feel awful.",1
983,Just looking for some reinforcement that I’m not making a mistake according to my grandmother.,"I recently started see this girl a little over three weeks ago, and I know it’s pretty early to be thinking anything long term.. but. 

I recently reconnected with a friend from high school and she’s been absolutely wonderful. And the feelings are reciprocal on her part. The thing is, she has two kids. A 2 1/2 year old girl and a 3 month old boy. I myself am sterile and unable to procreate. Her ex and father of her children is a complete deadbeat who has also abused her in the past both physically and emotionally. The 3mo is too young to understand anything yet but her daughter downright adores me already, as I do her. By what I’ve been told her ex lies, cheats, and steals any chance he can get because he’s a heroin addict. I don’t mean to criticize his addiction as I’ve been there myself with cocaine, but the bigger picture tells me he’s just a scumbag. End of story. 

Most of my family has been extremely supportive taking this route except my grandmother who, without going into great detail, is usually the trump card when it comes to family matters such as this and how it might affect our future. She thinks it’s a terrible idea and neither my girlfriend nor her kids are my responsibility, which I disagree with rather adamantly.  

This girl is a total sweetheart and looking at past experiences, she’s not like what I’ve seen in the past. Which is rather ugly. Again, I know it’s very early on in our relationship, I just don’t know whether I’m risking anything or getting ahead of myself seeing how well this is working out so far. 

Any advice is appreciated, thanks a bunch.",1

I met a girl a few months ago, i asked her if she wanted to drink something with me last month, she said sure only to come back the next day and say that it was purely as friends because she said that she thought that we'd never be more than friends because she needed attraction and she didn't see that come ánd because she said that her gut feeling told her that we would never be relationship material.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, over the last 3 weeks we talked quite a lot hung out a few times (only at musical events, because she seems to only see me and one of my friends as music buddies and not real friends) and it was always very nice and we clicked immensely.

&amp;#x200B;

Now 2 weeks ago the only thing i could do was cry whenever i thought about her and because of me being anxious of ruining the friendship if she would ever find out that i was this emotional about me being friendzoned.

So, things cooled down luckily and i was now in the acceptance phase. Until yesterday.

She was going to drive to a musical event with us in 2 days, randomly she messaged me today if it wasn't an issue to pick her up somewhere else, i said no i would be happy to help, she quickly changed to ""You know, it feels for me like it is a lot to ask from you, i'm going with my own car..."" And since that moment it's been sadness again. I was playing guitar, put it away after one strum and started crying at a friends house.. She said that all was going to go well, but i'm feeling so shitty about it..

Today i was with that same friend, we had a fun time.. Now i'm sitting here alone again, thinking about that girl who friendzoned me and i'm on the verge of tears..

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please give me some advice? I know ""move on"" is easy to say, but it's difficult for me to do that because i'm still seeing her, and i still want to hang out, make the friendship grow and see where life will take us...

410,Did I give off the wrong signals?,"Okay, so long story short. I started a new job recently. At my place of work, I'm in an awkward age group. I'm a 24F. Most of the people that work there are either in high school or they are older than me. I've talked to a couple of people just to socialize.

There's this one guy that is 19M that I talk to friendly. We joke around and I ask him about school. Normal things. Tonight he asked me for my snapchat. I was reluctant because of our age difference and asked him why. He laughed nervously, like I caught him off guard.

I proceeded to tell him not to send anything weird and quickly added like him drinking. I didn't want him to think I was talking about nude pics. He has a girlfriend, so I thought nothing of it.

I got off at work at 11 and added him on snap after work. I was ordering food when I got a notification he sent me a snap. I opened it and saw that he was shirtless, it only showed his face, but I could tell he wasn't wearing a shirt. It just said, ""Hey"" I said hey back and make a joke. He snapped me back a photo of him replying to my joke in the shower. Again, it was only his face, but I could clearly see the shower head in the back.

I then snapped him back telling him why the heck he'd snap me from the shower and that that was weird. I asked my sister if this was weird, because I'm not really experienced with men. She told me not to snap him. I haven't opened the photo and won't until it's morning.

I feel weird because I never gave him any vibes that I liked him. Some girls warned me he was an f boy. Am I jumping the gun? He didn't say anything sexual, it's just that he took the photo in the shower that made it really off-putting. Am I looking too far into it? How should I confront him that it made me uncomfortable? Should I steer clear of him?",1

456,My national exams are near but I just keep procrastinating despite knowing the consequences.,"This is quite a long winded explanation but I hope you guys can understand my situation.

My country's grading system is a point system where the lesser point you score the better your grades

Eg: A1(75% or above) to F9(40% and below) 

After the exams you'll get to choose a course(to get a diploma related to it) to attend.

Now the main reason why I procrastinate is because of this thing call EAE. EAE is basically a exercise where you interview to secure a spot for a course you want. I got accepted to an eleven pointer course and to get in I have to score 26 or lower points for exams.

Because of this I procrastinate because I realized that I do not have to work so hard during exams as I averagely score 18 pointers but I really want to study but I guess that I'm just a really lazy person.

So if you guys have any tips to help me stop procrastinating it will help me a lot. Thanks.",1

317,How to manage insecurities? Need help,"So lately I was stressing out a lot this 1st semester of my Senior High, I've noticed that many people (*especially my classmates*) were rich, normal, attractive and typical teens. I don't really have good looks and I don't get along well with my classmates (*I'm a loner btw*), plus, they always have high ass grades while I'm seating here on my seat doing everything I could, but my grades were fine enough. 

I was lowkey disappointed in myself because I see those people still manage to have social life (*friends, family, etc.*), while I started to lose mine since my schedule is hectic, and I started to lose and lose time for them (*both families and friends*). Due to crap ton of workload of my school, I also started to unfriend all my facebook friends because I wasn't even as active as before, and I don't even talk to them anymore because they were in a relationship with someone I didn't know of (*I meant they find their girlfriend/boyfriend*) and they ditched me irl before I accept their friend requests (*I was naive back then and hoped that we would have a reunion, but it didn't happen*). For my family, I barely talk to them because of our age gaps (*my cousins were like 10-20 yrs older than me*) and they also started their own family, I only have 1 grandma (*mother's side*) as of now, the rest of the family died already due to illness and old age. Plus, we're facing financial crisis so I kinda have problems for my school tuition and other stuff.

But yeah, sometimes, I feel down enough that I kept thinking things like *""Why am I so useless?"", ""I need to fit in and change"", ""Am I not good enough?"", ""Why do I don't have any best friend yet?"", etc.* Sorry I just blurted that long story I kinda needed to vent it out, it just distracts my thoughts.

88,My [18F] boyfriend [18M] wants my blessing to be sexually involved with other guys while we're LDR during our university terms,"So, my boyfriend and I are dealing with a little bit of strain because we've both gone to different universities, 300 kilometres away from each other. Romantically and emotionally, we're ecstatic in our love for each other. And to preface, he would never, ever do anything like this without asking me first. However, we've had some tough phone calls about the toll taken on sexual intimacy being so far apart.

I need help with what to say about his request. He essentially wants my permission to engage in sexual activity with other guys during the time apart. This wouldn't be often, just once in a while if the opportunity came up.

The thing is that I am a diehard monogamist, and sex is a really special thing to me. Before we started dating, he had had one serious relationship with another girl, yes, but before that and before our relationship, he had been with other guys (just one-time sexual things). We've talked about this, and if I was to allow him to do it, he would always communicate afterwards, just saying that he went to a party tonight, it happened with some guy, etc.

If I'm being honest, it's that he needs the sexual desire witha guy fulfilled, and even when we're home during reading week, christmas break, or summer, I obviously can't give him a dick to suck.

Any thoughts on this? My first instinct is to be a little opposed, but I want him to have a good time. Also, as an aside, I'm a little worried that I'm not going be as good sexually as these guys that he's with, so when we're back and together I'm worried he won't be satisfied as much haha.

**TL;DR, my boyfriend wants me to give him permission to hook up with guys just while we're apart at university, I'm not too fond of the idea.**

Anyway, what should I do in this situation? I appreciate your input.

6,I am supposed to return to work after a three month sabbatical and I feel so anxious I want to throw up.,"Background:


About three and a half months ago, I left my job on sabbatical to spend three months traveling around Europe. When I approached my job about me leaving, I didn’t expect them to approve the time off. I thought I would have to quit but, to my surprise, my manager gave me the time off. It’s a small company so my manager is also the Vice President.


Well, about a month and a half in, I returned to the US. My depression had taken a serious nosedive while I was traveling and, at the point I decided to return, I was contemplating suicide. Once I got home, I did not contact anyone, not even my friends about returning (Still haven’t). I went to a day program for depression and found it mostly non helpful but I have stabilized and am no longer actively suicidal. 


I have spent the month after the program working with my therapist and psychiatrist on therapy and finding the right meds but we have not made any great progress. I have been working at dealing with my depression for two years now, after many years of ignoring it, but improvements have been slow and minor. 


Time has passed. Next Monday is supposed to be the day I return. I need to contact my boss today about my return. I know he is already frustrated with my lack of communication. But I have spent the entire past week in breakdown mode. I am so scared of going back. I don’t know what I will tell my coworkers. I am scared of dealing with my bosses frustration. And I am really scared of returning to a job that I could barely manage mentally before, when I had my grand European tour to work towards and dream about on hard days.


Part of me really wants to not return. I still have plenty of savings and I have very strong reasons to believe I could find another job. But part of me thinks I should return. I genuinely like my coworkers and have missed them. The work environment is pretty low stress and I don’t want to burn the bridge that being given sabbatical leave and then immediately bailing before return would definitely burn. My boss, while ultimately being an okay guy, is the kind of person to hold grudges and is an important guy in the industry. Plus I have a family member that works in the same company and I am scared that it will reflect badly on them.


I have no idea what to do and am super overwhelmed. I was working with the plan to return for ~3 months (the minimum I figured I needed before leaving would be a dick move) and then try to find some part time work in my industry while I work on getting healthier. I still live at home so it would be feasible. But returning scares the hell out of me. I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to lie but I don’t want to tell the truth.

Do you think I should return or should I quit. If I return, what should I tell my coworkers when they ask about my trip?",1

947,How can I get vitamins and minerals without eating fruits and vegetables?,"This probably belongs on r/nutrition but it has been taken down multiple times because “it can be solved by a google search”.  So hopefully it works here.

Long story short, I was recently diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis, and it is essentially impossible for me to eat any whole fruits or vegetables because they are so high in fiber. They tear me up internally and I feel sick whenever I eat them.

Are there any alternative ways I can consume all the necessary vitamins and minerals from them without actually eating them? Green powders, juicing, vitamins, anything? 

I am pretty desperate as I am an active person and train regularly for marathons and triathlons, so I really need to get the proper stuff into my body. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks",1

668,Elderly neighbors having problems with the son of their next door neighbor,"Hello, I need some advice to help an elderly couple who live close by. They have notice that their vehicles and the vehicle of their children have been vandalized a couple of times. For example, the headlights in one of the vehicles has small round holes and cracks. The cars has dents that weren't there before (the husbandgripes the cars daily and gives them a quick inspection).

The main reason they suspect is the son of their neighbor (whom I will be referring to as Douche) is be cause of the following: back when he was a teenager he would walk into their garage and grab a soda from the mini fridge without asking, he used to have Bb gun fight with the other neighbor of the elderly leaving the elderly couples' house in the middle, he had been seen beating someone else's car with a stick, he used to trespass my parents house to go to the street behind, he was caught trespassing an old man's house too, and he's known as the only troublemaker of the neighborhood. No one called the police on him back then, because he was just a teenager and were hoping he would grow out of it, plus his mom is very aggressive. Anyways, he is an adult now with a family and had left his mother house, which was a passive time for the elderly couple.but for some reason he has returned to live with his mom once again, and that's when stuff started happening to the old couple. Sometimes they be asleep and they would hear someone banging in their windows, or they would wake up to spray paint on their vehicle. 

Now, the most recent even happened on this Monday. The husband was returning from his morning walk when he noticed Douche looking at his car and running away. The husband didn't think anything of it and went to work, and noticed that there was something wrong with one of his lights and stop to check it, and noticed that the headlight was cracked to hell. After he got back from work, he contacted the police and made a report. Unfortunately,  the officer told that without any evidence he couldn't do much, however if he could manage to get any evidence he could force Douche to pay for everything. The officer told the husband to save all the receipts for any repair and may other costs related to the case and that the case was going to be passed to a detective. After that the old couple asked if I could help them pick cameras for their home, I suggested that they should get dashcams and to place in their car in a manner Douche wouldn't see them. My point being that if they got house cameras Douche might not do anything and they would be left with the costs of repairing their vehicles. I felt really bad for the couple, they were even thinking of sleeping in their cars to catch Douche and were in the brink of tears. They don't understand why anyone would cause so much stress and harm to them. They told they have notice Douche carrying an air rifle around, which they believe he has been using to shoot their windshields and headlights. I want to help them, but aside of me watching their cars at night I can't think of anything. What could I do to help? Any advice? All of this is in the USA.",1

386,Should I choose the soul-sucking job or the unstable job?,"So this is more the people who have ""been there, done that"" when it comes to jobs and have either made massive mistakes or the best choices they could have. I should say first that I live in New Zealand so there aren't as many things I need to worry about in terms of job incentives.

I (28M) currently have two jobs - one at a supermarket, that I've had for 6 years now, and another I just started a few weeks ago which is basically like Uber Eats but a sort of organized company.

TL;DR on the supermarket job is that I only work part-time, can't get more hours, and the days are a mess (mon, wed, fri).  
The thing is for almost a couple of years now at this job, I have been having some weird anxiety about going to work. The job is boring, sure, but its easy. Problem is this anxiety means I hardly sleep before work (2 - 4 hrs max), I've tried everything from eating healthier, exercising, going to bed early, to getting prescription sleeping pills - none of which work.

The delivery job, however, means I can work as much as I want (70hrs/wk if I choose not to have a life) and everything is tax inclusive that I need for my job - car, gas, rent (apparently). However, the job has no real contract and, as they hire more staff as it gets busier, then I risk not being able to get as many hours. On top of that there is no holiday pay, of course. Again, its an easy job, chill and kind of relaxing driving around in the afternoon.

I also was looking at turning writing from hobby to profession at some point but the supermarket work has drained me so much for so long that I tend to not do anything between work days. I should add that it was only a few years ago that I use to work full time at the supermarket (only contracted monday but doing mon - fri anyway) and everyday after work I would come home and work out for an hour, I would also write during my breaks.

Everyone around me is, understandably, concerned about my future if I decide to take on the delivery job full time and quit the supermarket but I feel like it would be best for my health and happiness.

And to those who say something like ""its work, you're not meant to enjoy it"" or ""its not meant to be exciting"" - I am fully aware of that. The early years at the supermarket were enjoyable for me for that reason. I didn't have to think I just had to show up and do the work.",1

665,I really think my mom is lying to me.,"So I moved to my dads house from my moms and didn’t bring everything I had, one of the things I didn’t bring, was my computer. The panels on the side were off of it because something was wrong with it and I was trying to fix it. So it sat in my old room with the panels removed for however long, until when I come back to visit months later, it’s gone. 

I asked my mom what happened, she said that when she got new carpets, the carpet people must of moved it. Either to the attic or they threw it out, which doesn’t make sense. She said they told her it was missing components (wait, they told her it was missing components but they didn’t say whether or not they tossed it out? How’s this make any sense at all?). 

And I think there’s absolutely no way that people who install carpets are going to throw out a computer, whether of not they thought it was broken, it’s common sense, you just don’t do that. 

So what do you think? Is she lying to me? I think so, I’m kinda mad, not because my computer is gone but because she’s lying and could of easily verified whether of no to throw out my computer.",1

824,What are some activities/tips that are helpful in enjoying your own company and battling loneliness?,"The relationships in all aspects of my life aren’t going too well, including those with family, and especially “friends”.  Loneliness is something that I have been battling with for a while now, and almost daily. As time moves forward, it is getting worse… and I’m only in my twenties. I don’t have many friends for whatever reason, even though I’m just an average guy who has a decent number of things in common with the average person. Forming friendships is still incredibly difficult, as most of the time, it feels like the other side drifts away and loses interest. This includes my current “friendships” that I already have. I practically don’t even talk to anyone anymore, and they seem more like acquaintances. It is tough because I am a people person, yet for whatever reason it feels like nobody wants anything to do with me. At times, it feels like I’m the only person on this planet. That being said, I am trying to find ways to enjoy my own company and embrace the loneliness, as I am tired of not being able to find people willing to “meet halfway” in a friendship. I’ll still maintain a love for people, but I want to learn to spend quality time with myself.

775,I'm 18 and lesbian and i don't know how to not feel ashamed of my sexuality or scared of getting involved in relationships...?,"I never really got to start experimenting with relationships much in high school and I just feel like I don't know where to start.

My only experience started in middle school when after being homeschooled with no friends for 6 years I moved to a public school where for some reason I found myself really trying to gain acceptance from
this group of emo druggies (even though i've never used drugs), one girl in particular. She started to make me feel included and cool (looking back i think it was because she saw I was vulnerable). Eventually she asked me out and me having recently figured out I'm a lesbian decided to go ahead and try out a relationship.

It started out alright but then slowly got bad. She kept asking me to do her homework for her and whenever i did anything that she didn't liked she'd get really mad over it and start insulting me even in class. Eventually it started to escalate to the point where she hit me so hard it made my nose bleed. I told her I was going to go to the school administrators because this wasn't okay then she told me that if I did she would tell my parents i'm gay (which they're very not okay with)

so me being a scared and insecure middle schooler just brushed it off but i did try to distance myself from her but every time she would start crying or use some emotional manipulation to draw me back in

then one time she came up to me desperate for me to do her homework when I was working on my own and I calmly told her i couldn't. she got more and more insistant and I continued to tell her i couldn't. then she got angry and walked away and I thought she was just going to find someone else. Later I discovered she actually found my parents on facebook and outed me to them. 

so now my parents knew I was dating a girl and they freaked out I had my phone taken away for like a month or two and when they gave it back they'd still take it and go through it randomly to check my messages and see if I was talking to her, i wasn't allowed to stay after school unless i had a note from a teacher saying it was for tutoring (because they thought i could stay to hang out with her), i wasn't allowed to hang out with friends outside of school for the rest of high school. this despite the fact i hated her and didn't want to hang out with her anyway

(they knew my sister had a boyfriend around the same age and they said nothing so that shows you the double standard)

there was more stuff that happened later with her but that part is kind of irrelevant to this specific problem here. 

but basically i think that relationship kind of traumatized (?) me and i have no idea how i'll be able to actually 1) become comfortable with my sexuality. like i truly believe being gay isn't bad but i still feel ashamed of it for some reason and 2) how i'll be able to pursue a relationship without fear of it ending up like this again.

I’ve been here since July 2018. I’ve worked 100% by myself from day one. 

I’ve made a considerable amount of money over this time, I’ve paid lots too, but I can’t afford to hire someone to help me, and I can’t afford to hire a chef to make it more into a bistrot. 

I’m completely drained most days. It could be a burn out, I’m not sure. The atmosphere in the village I work is quite toxic, and even though it’s part of the job, I’m finding it hard to have to listen to people criticize others.

I haven’t taken any holiday since January, and that was just 5 days. 

I’m planing on taking some in November, but it’s after that that I’m thinking of shutting.

My dad has also suggested me renting rooms and a little house next door, but I just don’t think he realizes how much added pressure that will put. That it can’t be done just like that: it needs organisation, a portfolio, money, building, making sure water and electricity norms are followed, etc...

333,"My wife stopped one of my dreams from happening after supporting it all through dating. I’ve told her I forgave her but it’s been hard. It’s been a couple of years since it happened, and I have no intention of leaving her over this, so is this something I should bring up with her?","It was a passionate dream of mine to join the military. I informed my now-wife of this the very first week we were dating. She said it was hard, but she fully supported me. She continued to support me as I went through the process (it was a bit longer for me because I had to get some extra medical tests that we had to save money up for) and we got married in the meantime. Everything was fine until I was just a couple of days away from signing. Then, out of nowhere, she said she would not support me in that pursuit anymore.

What ensued was one of the more trying times of our marriage. I got severely depressed for awhile and gained forty pounds and dealt with serious feelings of betrayal. Eventually I snapped out of it, and I told her I forgave her.

Well, it’s been about two years since then, and I still can’t shake those feelings of resentment whenever I think of it. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to fully forgive her for what happened. With that said, it’s not something that’s constantly on my mind and I definitely don’t want to leave her or anything over it.

So here’s the advice I need. Is this something I should bring up to her and potentially open up a whole Pandora’s box of unproductive discourse (that’s how I imagine it, but it might not be as bad as all that) or just keep it inside like I’ve been doing and avoid that conflict?

Edit: To clarify, I am NOT seeking advice for whether to join or how to convince her to let me. I’m asking if I should try to hash out my feelings with her at the risk of potential conflict or if I should keep trying to resolve those feelings on my own.",1

724,my best friend ghosted me,"okay so i’m on mobile, just as a fyi

but this girl was new to our school last year and we weren’t friends at first but then got real close. we’d hang out everyday, we went over to each other’s places, my parents loved her, her dad loved me.

i took her on a trip to vegas one time, took her to fashion shows and places with me. and when she had no where to go i was there in 5 minutes to pick her up

this lasted about sixth months till she met another girl and kind of forgot about me. i was kind of hurt, but we still talked a bit. she lost interest and i brought this up with her. she didn’t realize that and we were back to normal i suppose. 

whenever we hung out now, she would say awful things about her “best friends”. like how bad they looked in a crop top or how they were so dramatic or “clout chasers”. this made me laugh, as when i would tell her to stop hanging out with them (which is what i did) she would always shrug it off. i feel like she might have been jealous, because all of these girls and guys were more fortunate than her as they had large houses and such. 

we then started fading again and this time i let it happen as i saw who she really was, although i still loved her, so it still hurt a bit. she then became even closer with her so called best friends (i was sort of friends with them, but per my last statement, stopped hanging out with them as much) and then told all of them not to trust me, and that i was annoying and had an attitude. she most likely said more, but that’s all what people were willing to tell me. 

i asked her directly if she had a problem with me, and i quote “no i think you’re a really great person”. 

now she’s been completely ignoring me, and when i’m talking to a group of people she knows, she’ll 100% ignore interaction with me. 

on a side note, when we were friends i had never talked bad about her, and i still don’t, so that couldn’t have been a reason why.

226,21-year old guy dating a 16-year old girl. Long post but I really need advice and opinions.,"The story isn't about me. However it is really bothering me and others and we have no idea what to do. Here's the full story:

This is about my gf's 16-year old sister. She is a very immature one would say even stupid, manipulative, doesn't care about school or her future and overall isn't a good person. She spends a lot of time online, talking to strangers and grown men. I'm not sure exactly how long ago but approximately 2.5/3 months ago she met this 21-year old guy online. They started ""dating"". Turns out the guy lives all the way across the country. He isn't ambitious in the slightest when it comes to his future.

 So after the two started talking they decided to meet each other for the first time. Yes, they started dating before even meeting in real life. She didn't even bother telling her parents about this guy, they found out by accident. The guy travels across the country to where we live and he rents out a hotel room for a couple of days. The day comes where she brings this guy home. Now this is where you can start to tell this guy is strange, her mum was sitting in the living room as they walked in and he didn't even bother to introduce himself or say hello. He sort of just looked at her mum and went upstairs. Similar thing happened to my gf, he walked past her and looked at her without saying a word. I get that you can be shy or anxious but come on. I was filled with anxiety when first meeting my gf's parents but I tried my best to make a good impression so that they would feel safe that their daughter is with me. At this point my gf and her mum are concerned and already don't like the guy. So the sister and her new ""boyfriend"" spend a few hours together and then the time comes for him to leave, yet again he didn't say a word to either of them. Please note this as it'll be relevant: I've been with my gf for almost two years now, I'm soon turning 20 and I've only just been granted permission by her parents to sleep at their house with my gf after asking them myself. Which is fair enough, they wanted to get to know me better and wanted to trust me. Luckily they like me.

So a couple of weeks go by since the guy was last here. One day the sister walks downstairs to speak to her mum. She notifies her that he will be sleeping at their house for a couple of nights because he is coming over again. She didn't even bother asking. Her dad is away for a couple of months and didn't know about this taking place. At this point her mum is really pissed off. She says that she doesn't approve of this ""relationship"", that she doesn't know this man and doesn't want him sleeping in her house, let alone with her 16-year old daughter. However, as I've said before, the sister is extremely manipulative and put her mum under so much pressure that she finally gave in and reluctantly agreed to him staying over. This came as an extreme shock to me and my gf as we waited almost two years to be able to sleep together. Yet she let a random 21-year old man who her daughter has known for just 3 months, who lives across the country, who she doesn't know at all sleep in her house. Yeah there was a condition that he can sleep there but only in the living room and not with her, but still. Pretty damn weird and annoying. So let's do a quick mid-story summary: a 16-year old girl met a 21-year old guy, on the internet about 3 months ago, her parent's basically have no idea who he is as he hasn't even introduced himself so he is technically a stranger to them and he is going to spend 3 days sleeping in their house. 

Friday comes around and that is when the guy arrives. This time he actually said hello to her mum. Still, her mum is very concerned and not at all happy with the ""relationship"". Not much happened that day so I'll skip till sunday (yesterday). So sunday comes around and her mum has to leave the house for a day to work so my gf's grandmother came round for the night. She had no idea about this guy being over. So her grandma comes over and sees a grown man walking around the house, a stranger. She asks my gf who he is and once she finds out that it is her 16-year old granddaughter's boyfriend she instantly got extremely angry. Her grandmother doesn't f\*ck about, so she went and spoke to the guy, asked how old he is, if he goes to uni, if he has a job, where he's from etc. He told her his age, that he's from the other side of the country, doesn't go to uni and doesn't have the most stable of jobs. This made the grandmother even more angry. She basically tells him that he is a grown man dating a child and the he should be ashamed of himself. She was even concerned for her own safety as this is basically a stranger, in fact she was so concerned she asked if I can also spend the night so that she felt safer. So I did. The grandmother calls my gf's mum and almost started shouting at her, asking why has she allowed an adult stranger to sleep at her house and that she should kick him out, with which the mum agreed. Remember when I said that the condition for him staying over was that he has to sleep in the living room separately? Well that was completely ignored. They waited until her grandmother went to sleep and they went and slept in the same bed. Which to me just sounds really disgusting. A grown 21-year old man sleeping with essentially a 16-year old child in the same bed. I wake up this morning and my gf's grandmother calls me over and tells me that the guy slept in the same bed. She said that she was extremely disappointed with her younger granddaughter and she didn't think that she was that stupid. She was so angry that she was almost shaking. I go upstairs to my gf and tell her that the guy slept with her sister in the same bed. My gf is fuming at that point. I walk out of the room to the bathroom to see the guy walking around in not his house that he was reluctantly let in to, in nothing but his underwear, which to me just shows a complete lack of respect. I would never walk around half-naked around my gf's parent's house. I thinks it's just common sense. 

I'm posting this here because me, my gf and her grandmother have no idea what to do. The mum is so manipulated by her daughter that she has almost nothing to say. We have no idea who this guy is and what his intentions are, to everyone he just seems like a creep. Both my girlfriend and her grandmother have expressed a concern over their safety and the safety of the 16-year old. I'm also concerned, considering there is a stranger, a grown man who obviously is just really weird, walking around the same house that my gf is in. So I'll just repeat this little summary. A 21-year old with no plans for his future or ambition, who also doesn't seem too intelligent is dating and sleeping with a 16-year old girl. I get that age gaps in relationships are common and for me are nothing strange. But when it's between two adults that are at the same stages in their lives. A 21-year old man is at a much different stage in life than an emotionally developing 16-year old girl who will go through like three different stages in her life before she reaches his age.

840,How can I help my friend with her problems?,"So, for context, my friend is probably the best person I know.

We’ll call her M.

At home, M is constantly being compared to her sister and being told she isn’t good enough, and I want to help her. She’s also being pulled down by our friends with how they ignore her when she’s angry, but she doesn’t do the same to them. She has around 8 mental health apps on her phone, but none of them are helping all that much. She’s in a really dark state, and she helps all of us when we have problems.

I really want to help her with her mental health, but I don’t know how. I don’t have that experience at home, and I don’t know what it feels like to go through that, so I can’t relate to her. All of the friends we have that ignore her and are rude to her a lot are on my side and are always nice to me, so I also can’t relate with that.

She can’t use herself, and I can tell she’s having really dark thoughts. She has anger issues, but some of my friends think it’s just funny. I really, really want to let her out of the darkness, but I sincerely don’t know how. 

I really need help. Thank you.",1

902,In love with my adviser (undergraduate)," I recently started college at a top uni in the US. It's been a very difficult transition for me, because this uni is super white. And I have been experiencing a lot of xenophobia. Not overt, of course, but implicit. I am female, and both a religious and racial minority, as well as being low-income.

So this adviser wasn't supposed to be more than an occasional academic resource. But as soon as I met him, I realized he was so warm, in a way that I didn't feel from many other people at this place. And when I met him for the second time, in his office, I cried and told him how much I wasn't fitting in. He was super compassionate. He told me to come see him again; he saw that I was struggling and I think he realized that his office was one of the only spaces I felt safe.

When I next saw him, I cried again. He offered to see me regularly. At this point, he became more like my therapist than an adviser. We mainly talked about college - we don't much discuss personal things. But the sense of emotional catharsis I gained from my meetings with him became addictive. I began falling in love with his understanding of race and class dynamics. It's so rare to see this level of perspective.

Now I find myself thinking about him all the time. I look forward to my next meeting with him weeks in advance. I think about what to talk to him about. I daydream about him constantly.

I'm very disappointed in myself. I know I'm just attracted to an image of him, transference or whatever, power dynamics blah blah, but like, seriously. I didn't know I was this susceptible to falling in love with random white men who were kind to me.

Advice appreciated!",1

For a while she told us she had tinnitus and constantly told us we needed to do certain things to help her because of it. We eventually found out that numerous doctors have confirmed there is nothing wrong with her ears and she does not have tinnitus.

Then she told us she had vertigo. She stopped rather quickly when she found out my mother has vertigo and has spent periods of months in the past unable to get out of bed.

And this has kep going on. She's self-diagnosed many more conditions and it always ends with her bringing herself to different doctors who confirm she does not have the condition.

The most recent self diagnoses has been for endometriosis. It's really awful because we have a close mutual friend who does actually have endometriosis and has had multiple surgeries, has been on birth control and strong medication for years, and still ends up in intense pain. My mutual friend with endo has been quite upset because of this, as she feels that the level of pain she experiences is being turned into something brag-able.

946,Sister infatuated with a monster,"TLDR My sister is infatuated with a guy that regularly verbally, emotionally, and physically abused his girlfriends. Says shes never seen that side of him so its hard to believe. 

Hey reddit. Ive had probably the most stressful week of my entire life. My little sister is 19 and moved in with me to start college a few months ago and its been great. We've always been really close. About a month ago she started hanging out with a group of guys from her work, like party types, I was worried but I trusted her to be safe and what not. Well she developed a ""thing"" for one of the guys and hes one that I know is a scumbag. He dated my boyfriend's friend for years and she told him he called her ugly and fat constantly and cheated on her all the time. I was quick to express it bothered me and that I dont understand why should would want him but she's an adult that can make her own decisions. THEN I learned he would regularly beat the hell out of his last girlfriend, berated her when her fathered died, and was addicted to sex. We sat my sister down and talked about everything and shes very upset but she said it's done. I assumed it was because of the abuse but she told me it's more because my bf and I cant stand him. She kept saying things like ""Hes never been like that with me "" or ""He's always been so nice and respectful and we have so much in common"" she says it's over but she previously told me she wasn't going to date him and then did anyway. I'm so stressed I havent been eating or sleeping. I dont know what to do. How can keep my sister safe?

Oh also he also dated a 15 year old as a 19 year old which is also gross. Just a shitty guy.

696,My dad found out my mom lost their savings gambling/having an affair... where to go from here,"This is a bit of a doozy... but looking for any help.

Just some background, I’m currently in university and my older brother is done school and with a solid job.

My parents have been married for 25 years and are European immigrants and we can be considered typical middle class salary-wise. Looking back, I can see that my parents never had a really intimate relationship and would sometimes have money problems (mom was always in charge of finances since Dad isn’t fluent in English).

My dad just got a call from the bank last week saying something is going on. We turned out to find my mom has been going to the casino and gambling the past few years and has lost most of their savings. My dad found out the past few months she would go to the casino occasionally and lose a few hundred dollars a month and she promised to him she would stop going. But when he looks at the bank history now, sees this has been going on for longer and she has lost almost all of their savings. Too, over the years huge chunks of their savings have been disappearing at a time.

Financially, I know my parents have never been the most well off and not the best savers. They still have their mortgage to pay off, and have a pretty large house. My mom had job issues the past few years and I know my parents haven’t been doing great financially recently.

From what I can tell this has lead to her being overstressed and started her gambling so much. Too, given my mom from what I can tell hasn’t been fully in the marriage (She doesn’t feel loved/happy the way she should be... refers to herself as suffering by being with my dad) so I understand how it got to this point. More to add, my dad has told me he caught her cheating on him multiple times, with him giving her multiple chances to fix up her act.

With this all in the open now, Im just looking for any advice on what I should do. Right now my parents don’t know if they will stay together or not. My dad has every right to leave but in his mind the marriage and family is all he has known (in his mid-50s now and heavy Catholic). He doesn’t have friends outside of his coworkers so I know it’s gonna be hard for him to go on his own (also I’m in school in another city far away so I can’t exactly be near to support him... I’m a 5 hour drive away). My mom is not sure what to do because she doesn’t know if my dad will ever trust her again even if she stays and tries to fix it. My mom has lots of friends so going on her own I think she’d be fine.

Honestly, this has been a lot and I’m trying to not take sides in this because they’re both my parents and I don’t know if it’s right to take a side. My mom brought up before that she wanted my dad to try more since she wasn’t happy with how he treats her, and over the past couple months they seemed to be doing a lot better since she brought it up with him (ie. going for walks together, mini food-dates, holding hands, too he drinks a lot less which is something she has had problems with).

So right now I’m just looking for any input/advice I can get on the situation. Should they stay together and try to fix it, even if it means they aren’t actually in it to be together but stay together for the sake of being married? Also how can I help them figure out how to stay together if that’s they’re choice. If they do split up, what can I do for my dad since his savings are gone and he is in his mid 50s... too I worry he’ll go into depression being alone since I’m so far away for school and he has no one close other than our family. Honestly if you have any other input about anything else regarding this situation, it is much appreciated.

TL;DR Dad found out mom gambled away savings and having affair. They don’t know if they should stay together, and I don’t know what I should do to help.",1
184,Sloth vs. Unicorn,"“I’m a fucking unicorn, and fuck anybody who says I’m not,” Tyler the Creator. I’m a fucking unicorn, but upon my back I carry a sloth. I feel like I have the social skills, the intellect, and the opportunities to accomplish anything I dream. But I’m often forsaken by a lack of willingness to follow through with anything, my sloth. I will sometimes feel extremely motivated to accomplish a new dream, I often even take the first steps to getting where I want to. For a while I’m very happy and excited to be traveling down this new path. But then it’s like the sloth is pulling the reins, first I slow down, put it off a day, and then another, and then the next thing I know I’ve been in full sloth mode for 6 weeks and all my motivation to do what I once thought was my dream is gone. When I’m in sloth mode I do the bare minimum of anything, I’ll lay in bed until 2 o’clock, barely finish any homework I may have, run late to everything, sometimes only eat one meal a day out of pure laziness, let everything I need to do pile up, smoke way too much weed, and just avoid all the things I know I should be doing. But then eventually I snap out of it, and I feel like I could’ve snapped out of it all along but I was just too comfortable to shed the sloth. I feel good for a little bit but then my mind is just racing so fast that I get anxious. Horribly anxious where I’m thinking about everything I should’ve done and should be doing and it all comes crashing down in private moments I scream at myself and hit things and get angry for wasting my life away. I just get so frustrated with myself and stress flows through my body like it’s in my veins. I stress about everything from not reading a certain book to how this world is gonna end. I always try to remind myself that everything is going to be ok but I also feel like that is just sloth trying to get me to slow down again. How do I hold sloth at bay while not losing my shit when I actually allow myself to care about what I’m doing?
TLDR: I’m either a lazy fuck or losing my mind while trying to accomplish my dreams.

I decided to save money for this trip before I met my girlfriend, and she can’t go on the trip for financial reasons. Every time I bring up the trip(it doesn’t necessarily have to be me) she gets super upset and emotional. We are very clingy towards each other and miss each other easily. Early this summer, she went to Hawaii the same amount of time I’d be gone in Europe and I was sad and upset too. She asked where I’m going today and all I said was that I have a Europe meeting to go to, and she started crying. She does get emotional pretty easily, but this is hitting her hard.

513,How do I tell a few friends what my boundary’s are when it comes to joking around?,So I’m 15 and I have a few friends who when we are joking around they don’t know what I’m not ok with joking about.

But something I’m not ok with being joked about with is my speech impediment the mocking to me isn’t funny. Like I say something and I completely messing up the pronunciation and most of the time I know I did you don’t need to tell me ; they chuckle then repeat it back exaggerated. That’s really something I’m insecure about and something I had been really badly bullied about all through out elementary and part of middle school. So I don’t even like it when people bring it up at all. Another thing is with a different friend she is one of those people who when she talks like she puts her hand on your leg or shoulder and just hugs a lot. So I sorta was like “hey I don’t want this to be awkward but like I don’t like being touched.” So now she just very annoying pokes me. And when someone comes up and hugs me and I either just stand there or very awkwardly just go with it. After she is like “I thought you didn’t like to be touched hmm?!” Then sorta laughs. Idk I just don’t know how to tell my friends where my lines are like at what point I don’t find something funny? Without it being awkward. See not to long ago I would have just been like it’s easier to just ditch them instead and go find other friends which never works out anyway since I have a very difficult time socializing and meeting new people my age. I’m great with old people though I can’t wait to be an old lady. I could nap and do some sudoku and pet some cats and play some bingo. Anyway I really just don’t know how to approach this.

594,"Just found out now as a teenager that my parents almost divorced when I was like 4, don't know how to feel about it","The title mostly says it, but to give a little bit more context, it all centered around the house my family lived in at the time, and it would still be our house if what happened hadn't happened, but apparently my mom did a lot of lying, stupid things, and hiding of said stupid things and put us in a really bad situation with the house, and it made my dad really angry with her to the point that he almost divorced her. The only reason he didn't was for me and my older sister's sake because we were both young and he didn't want us to have to grow up in the kind of broken home that he did when he was a kid. But since he didn't divorce her, he had to not only create an excuse to tell me and my sister for years as to why we moved out so suddenly, but he also had to try and do whatever he could to make ends meet so that the culmination of all those bad things my mom did wouldn't happen. What would've happened had he not done that is that we would've been kicked out of our house and become homeless because of whatever my mom did. He didn't exactly tell me what all she did because even after all these years he still doesn't know all the exact details himself because he never could get them all.

I just don't know how to feel about it, I don't know whether to be sad, angry, just upset, hurt, somewhere in between all of those? I just don't know and that just seems to be making it worse, and since I don't know, the only place I thought to ask was here because I don't want to worry my friends or other family members with it.",1

0,Introducing the Advice Point and User Flair System,"## **Officially launched Open Beta. Feedback appreciated! Please comment your thoughts below.**

See the TL;DR stickied comment for a summary. 

---

Hello advice givers! **We are proud to announce that we are currently testing out a new system.** You will be able to earn points for providing advice, and earn flair levels too. 

Right now, we think that on average, threads do not receive enough helpful advice. There is no incentive to be helpful! Many people ask for advice every day, and a lot of these requests go unnoticed or ignored. We also think that thread creators don't respond enough. We want to encourage both for a more vibrant and robust community. 

**So, we are introducing our Advice Point system!** 


---

## **How it works**

Whenever OP submits a thread, the automoderator will provide a comment with instructions. Long story short, if OP responds to a comment with the word ""helped"" in any way, the commenter will receive an **Advice Point.**

Your Advice Point score can be seen on your user flair. This is a little title that's next to your name. The more points you get, the cooler your title. Here's a list of what we have so far. 

**TLDR: If you are OP, please respond to comments with the word ""Helped"". If you are a commenter, don't do anything different, just remind OP to respond with that specific word if they find your comment helpful.**

Point Requirement | Title 
---|---
1 Point | Helper
5 Points | Unlicensed Counselor
10 Points | Expert Advice Giver
20 Points | Master Advice Giver
40 Points |  Phenomenal Advice Giver
60 Points | Advice Guru
100 Points | Advice Oracle
150 Points | Enlightened Advice Sage
200 Points | Assistant Elder Sage
300 Points | Elder Sage 

---

## **So what's the point of this?**

Well, nothing really. But we have found that people generally like to be helpful. We want to give recognition to the people who have helped our community. These people deserve to be commended and praised for their help, and this is how we want to do it. 

There is no monetary benefit, and having a higher rank title doesn't make your advice any more important than anyone else's. However, it will show the history of your helpfulness. 


---

## **Helpful tips**

- Only OP can award points. If you are not OP, and you use the word ""helped"" in your comment, automod will let you know that no points will be awarded.
- OP can award 1 point per person per thread. 
- OP can award 1 point to *multiple* people in the thread. All advice is helpful and if OP got helped by everyone, that's fantastic!

---

## **We will test this system out for a minimum of one month, to give users a chance to chime in and provide their opinions.** 

Please be patient with us, as this will be an Open Beta test, **you may experience minor bugs or issues**. Please feel free to let us know if anything goes wrong. If people are not happy with this system, we will remove it and return things to normal. 

Finally, feel free to include any suggestions or thoughts below. Happy advice-giving!",1
388,Feel like I’m wasting my life,"I’m having trouble figuring out if I should go to uni or not. This is going to be really long so I’m sorry in advance!

For background information, I have been the ‘‘smart kid’’ my whole life. I think that I just wanted to please my narcissistic mother by being the smart one in the family, and thought this would make her happy, so I tried really hard. As in, would study for hours per night, wanted to be a doctor, volunteered to put it on my resume kind of smart kid. I studied so hard (literally before school, between breaks, 6 hours after school and 8 hours each day of the weekend) that I got an ATAR of 99 in my final year of high school (for non-Australians, it basically put my score in the top 1% of my state for the exam year). This gave me so many options with what I could do with my life - I could do vet medicine easily, or get into medicine, or get a direct entry pathway to become a JD... and me thinking uni was the only way, I went. I was pushed in part by my mother, who didn’t want me to make her mistakes, and wanted me to study hard and get my masters early and all that stuff. I thought that I would be so happy having every option within my reach, and that I would feel so successful and proud, and I did- for a few days. Then it was just about doing the next mind blowing thing. It gave me a feeling of emptiness, that no matter how hard I try I will never be fulfilled. That I would never be enough. 

Fast forward two years, and I’m currently still so burnt out by studying. I don’t see the value in it anymore because it holds no reward for me.  I look back to those days in high school and realise that I had no social life, I was stress eating, gaining weight, I was depressed and anxious. In uni later on, I was enrolled full time, and as smart as I am, I was failing units because I was so drained and couldn’t bring myself to sit at my desk. I thought it would all be worth it because having a prestigious career would make me happy for life. It’s like being high functioning caused my intelligence, but also the depression that has ruined me.

Now, I have realised, in part, that there is more to life than grades (my perfectionist attitude was killing me) and I have deferred uni to complete a diploma. This diploma can get me into a job with decent money, which I will find very rewarding, where I can work my way up. Realistically, I am much happier and less stressed now, 

However, I still have a voice in my head (probably my mums voice lol) telling me that I wasted my potential, that I ‘peaked in high school’ etc. l will always strive for excellence no matter what I do, and I know that even if you put me in the least prestigious field ever, I would still work hard and strive upwards and do well. 

I know this is a bit all over the place, and I’m sorry that it’s so long. Basically what I’m asking is, do you think I have wasted my potential? Should I feel like a drop kick? Should I go back and ‘tough it out’ and be harder on myself like everyone else? Or is it more a case of me catching a well needed break and being kind to myself? Should I listen to my family? 

I’m not sure what would be the healthiest way to go. I recognise in a sense that it’s an investment to go to uni, because I would make a lot of money in the future, but I also know myself, and I know that I would beat myself up for another 4 + years if I went, and that’s what i’m struggling with. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks so much :))",1

935,I have driving anxiety.,"About four years ago, I took my parents' car without permission (I was like 17), and crashed it on the freeway in a really bad accident.

No one got hurt, thank God.

Predictably, my parents did not let me keep driving after that. Then I left for college, where I didn't have a car and didn't get much practice.

At this stage of my life (I'm 21), pretty much everyone drives regularly. You drive from your house to wherever you're interning, you drive when you're hanging out with your friends, etc. At this point, it's expected.

I just have a lot of anxiety going back into it. Do you have any advice?

Back when I was taking my parents' car without permission, I was reckless, but I was anything but anxious. I want to find a sweet spot in the middle, where I'll be conscientious, but not unreasonably paranoid.

It doesn't help that you see at least one or two crazy drivers every time you drive on the freeway for any more than half an hour.",1

I know my friends and family will be disappointed because of the dynamic of our relationship but honestly I’m so happy with her, sometimes after a while it just feels hard to be grateful for it... in the end we always come back to eachother, right now we are just taking things slow, trying to improve ourselves and just letting time decide what happens. Am I making a bad decision? Or are long lasting relationships always meant to have hard roads ahead? And advice or insights would be greatly appreciated",1
248,My bathroom ceiling collapsed,A portion of the bathroom ceiling collapsed. Apartment upstairs had a leak or something. Not looking for legal advice but rather what steps should be taken next. I removed all the towels and anything else thats important from the bathroom. However my family still insists that its safe to use the room. The collapse happened over the shower and the toilet is untouched. Im concerned that that the collapse made the rest of the ceiling weak and if there is a chance it could fall on a person. Plus there is a very nasty smell coming from there so i want to just close the door and not open it again untill a professional comes. So while i would rather use a neighbor's bathroom my family still wants to use ours. Is it safe to use or not? Any other general advice is good too. I would post a picture if i was able to,1

703,I’m trying to improve my confidence in confrontational situations without compromising my receptiveness to the people I’m confronting.,"I’m a young adult (M23). I understand that, at this age especially it’s more valuable to listen when in a disagreement with someone but I am still confident in most situations that things are a matter of perspective and whoever I’m speaking to would benefit just as much from seeing mine as I do seeing theirs. 

Some background on what kind of situations I find myself in; I have 5+ years experience in my particular field of work, in which I hold a semi-managerial role and am currently competing for promotion to manage the accounts in our district. I am also a managing partner of 2 too a personal business on the side. 

The main criticism I have for myself is whenever I’m explaining myself to someone I often find my words to greatly lag behind in articulation to my thoughts immediately after the discussion has taken place. I know this is common but my stress comes from how much I’ll carry on in my head about what I should have said or what I’m going to say AS soon as that scenario presents itself again but it rarely ever does. 

An example for clarity; A client wants a process done in a way that is less efficient for their own budget but that’s the way they want it because it’s worked for them in the past. They are hiring the company I work for because what they want done is our specialty. Throughout my experience I’ve found a more cost effective way of operating and because the client doesn’t focus on the process full time they don’t understand it as well. Usually after a short explanation of my thoughts if the client pushes back I opt for their way at the cost of efficiency because their happiness outweighs the nuances of the “how”. The dilemma I face is that whenever this happens if I could just articulate a bit better they would be even happier with the process yielding better results and costing less and I would be happier by not thinking about the conversation that took place all day lol. 

That example doesn’t not perfectly frame up with every situation this problem occurs in. Sometimes it’s just simply someone telling me I’m living my life wrong. That happens a lot but the issue remains that while talking about it my brains silent and after it’s over with it’s full of rebuttal. This causes me to be less vocal then I want to be in situations I have the ability to stand out in. 

How do you guys mentally process the dichotomy of confidence in order defend your perspective while truly accepting and understand the person you are talking to? At what point do you discredit that persons opinion and decide to stop being receptive and just dig in to your own confidently? How do you do that in the best way for the client or person to understand your intentions?

The problem is that the teachers don't explain anything and they always require us to learn the definitions correctly like it is written in the book, even though we don't understand them. I only learn at home. Since my grades dropped, my parents are blaming it on the fact that I was homeschooled last year and that I am too lazy and don't want to study. I have a social life outside of school, so that wouldn't be a problem. Every time I try to bring up the topic, they tell me to shut up and the only argument that they provide is ""You are a student and you have to go to school"". In my country if you are homeschooled you learn by yourself, without the help of your parents. The program in my old school was harder.",1

I know I don’t want to be in school and I’m trying to make myself go and it is going so badly. Should I just drop out at this point and work until I figure out a game plan or find something without a degree. I’m super creative and I feel like my life is being controlled at school I feel trapped.,1

495,I [27M] have spent thousands of dollars on Escorts and massage parlors to try to solve my loneliness issues.,"I have finally gotten a good decent paying job, but it seems like the only thing holding me back mentally is my severe loneliness. 

My problem started when I was very young in elementary school. I avoided any type of social interaction with both students and teachers. Kids would literally offer to give me $20 if I said 1 word to them. I managed to get to 5th grade without saying a single word to anyone at school. This resulted in my failing a grade twice and my social development being stagnant. I started coming out of my shell when I start playing Runescape with some friends. My social development continued to slowly grow, but not significantly at all. I just became slightly more comfortable talking to people.

During college, I decided to go to a doctor and got diagnosed with social anxiety. I am not entirely sure why, but 6 months later I decided to taper off the medicine. I started to be less comfortable taking medicine every day.

After this point, I still barely interacted with people. To this day, I do not know how to have ""small talk"" or even a conversation that lasts more than 30 seconds. 

My problem: My problem is two problems wrapped into one problem. I am incredibly lonely and I don't know how to have a conversation with people. These two problems have made me want to go out into the world and pay people just to be around me. This ranges from Escorts to cuddling services to massage parlors. Even in these situations I can't maintain any type of conversation for more than 30ish seconds. 


How do I even approach this problem? I want to get better but I don't know how. I just want to be able to have a good conversation with people. Everything seems so dam overwhelming.

.


Honestly, I don't know where to start. Ever since I was young I've had a lot of emotional trauma. I can remember being six years old sitting outside of my home with my mom as she cried because my dad left us. Eventually ended up not paying for the mortgage on the house we lived in (even though he promised) and we got kicked out and lived with my grandma for about two years. I visited my dad briefly throughout the years. He is a truck driver and when he gets loads to visit we would be lucky to have a day with him. I would visit every summer and every other Christmas over 1,000 miles away but ultimately never got close with him. That didn't effect me until I got older.

.


After the two years of living with my grandma my mom found a boyfriend. They ended up getting married when I was about ten years old. They were together for two years before getting married and we moved in with him before marriage because my mom got pregnant. Anyway, he wasn't perfect but he was a real father figure, although my father was still in the picture.


.

I had my first suicidal thought at 10 years old.

.

 The first one I can clearly remember is seeing a butcher knife in my kitchen and wonder why I don't just stab it into my arm. I never acted on such nasty thoughts until I was 14 when I began cutting myself. Honestly, I was sad as fuck. An administrator found out I was cutting myself and of course told the guidance counselor who called my mom and stepdad. Of course they did something about it. I went to a therapist but it was super short lived and I stopped cutting. 


.


Until I was 16. When I was 15 almost 16 I found this girl that really changed my life. I liked her a lot and ended up catching some serious feelings for her. Two months after dating, come to find out my mom found out my stepdad was cheating on her on Christmas day 2015. I was over 1,000 miles away and it broke me. Ruined me completely. It broke my mom... her second failed marriage. She is so sad and so lonely it kills me. 


.


Anyway, this girl and I continue dating and she truly helps me get through this. In about February of 2016 things get rough between her and I though. We are young and don't know how relationships are suppose to work. We become jealous, spiteful, and just straight up toxic for each other. She would mentally and emotionally abuse me. Message ex's and then delete the message or wouldn't let me see them. She would break up with me to hangout with people she liked only to come back to me knowing I would take her back. There was one instance where I was hit in the back of the head with a straightener and I cried but she didn't seem to care much. Edit: she hit me with the straightener. That lasted until I was freshly 18, but by 17 I was already numb to her tricks.


.


By that I mean I didn't feel things. I didn't feel love the same, I didn't feel sad anymore. I genuinely became so numb after years of staying up all night crying, just to go to school and be miserable all day. I have this one specific memory where I was sitting up in bed, with the moonlight shining through the window and my life was genuinely like a movie. Me crying hoping I could get over this. When I said that I didn't mean I wanted to be numb. 


.


Through that relationship I grew up a lot and stopped caring what people thought of me, but what came with that was numb. Which is the part where I need advice on. 


.


I get sad of course, I won't ever deny that. What's the issue though is that I find myself getting over saddening things extremely quickly, almost too quickly. I absolutely cannot cry for more than three minutes, I can be sad and sniffling but physically tears won't come out of my eyes anymore. And it's almost like I reach this sadness limit and I just become numb. Can't cry, can't be sad, it's just a complete emptiness. 


.


Most of the time, even when I'm alone, I can't cry more than like three tears before I hit that limit. But when it gets really bad, I only cry for literally three minutes and then I can't anymore. I can't feel sadness and this emptiness isn't better. I can be happy and I can be frustrated but sadness just seems to really make me stop feeling anything. 


.


Then the emptiness last for so long. I am happy most of the time, genuinely. When I need to feel something else I just can't and get into this weird nothingness state. I need to feel other emotions so i remember that I'm not a robot or some shit. I need to let out this lurking sadness but I physically and mentally won't allow myself, even if I want to. 


.


I also haven't found a love as deep and strong as that girl. I've had plenty of other S/O's but I cannot feel love the same. I don't have feelings for the girl anymore, it's been over a year and a half and I could absolutely never see myself being with her again but damn man, when I loved her I loved her to my max and it ruined me. How do I feel sadness and get this build up of darkness out of me? I am done being empty when I just want to cry and let myself be sad for more than ten minutes. Please help.",1
575,Not sure what to do,"I want to focus on important aspects of life and not get distracted from doing well and moving forward in life. I do keep myself busy with work and stuff, but due to being depressed I tend to focus too much on anything that will lift my mood. And sometimes that ends up being someone I have a crush on, someone that makes the day a little better. But it’s a problem because I get wrapped up in my feelings too much and care more than I should about someone that may just be in my life for a little while. I just end up thinking about finding someone to share life with and build each other up and be happy with. But I know that’s not what I need to focus on. I don’t want to, but it’s difficult not to think about someone that makes my day a little better when most days are sad. I know need to work on myself and getting to a better place, being more emotionally stable and well. I don’t think I should be thinking about a crush when I’m depressed.

828,I accidentally scheduled a party on my friends B-day,"Okay, so every year I normally organize a big party around the weekend of halloween. Last year I wasn't able to host because of school matters. Now that I'm able to I decided to put it the week before Halloween because alot of my friends suddenly want to get into trick-or-treating. 

This wouldn't be a problem if my friend (let's call her Janice) didn't tell me it was on the date of her party. I asked her about decor, who to invite, and the even when the date of the party should be. We even named it the ""Pre-spook"". Janice never plans ahead, all her past birthday parties have been around a week or two after her actual birthday. I'd always assumed she was born around the 1st of November.

Now Janice has sent out texts to everyone about how she is going to have a big party at a the mall. Her party starts at 11 (three hours before mine), but the invitation doesn't say when it ends so that means you can come and leave when you want. Knowing this everyone is going to stay at the mall with her and the two weeks of planning will be a waste. 

A few of my friends are really pissed and are telling me no compromises because I've been trying to make the party a success. Any advice?",1

782,"Is falling in love supposed to be ""exciting""?","I'm curious what the feeling of falling in love is supposed to be like. The one time I've truly fell in love, I've felt a mixture of: strong attraction, arousal, caring, and concern. As well as anxiety over the current circumstances I was facing in life, coupled with the environment I found myself in with my crush (how it was going to work out, where it was ""going""). Which all just cumulated in my losing lots of sleep.

I've never really felt ""excited"" when interested in someone before; I feel that sort of feeling is more reserved for high-school-aged students, or students really young at university, just starting out in life. Or am I wrong?

Coming to think of it, I'm hardly ever ""excited"" about anything nowadays. I'm not depressed. I suppose this lack of excitement is a product of the culture I come from (where we don't even have a word for ""excitement""), but I like to have stable emotions now after many years of emotional highs and lows. I feel content, amused, and happy, which is how I prefer to feel most of the time now as much as possible, and find the good in life...",1

381,"My dad is nearing death and I despise him, but I worry I’m gonna regret not spending time with him once he dies.","My parents got divorced in 2011, four years later he had a stroke. To this day, he still can’t talk coherently or walk properly. He couldn’t find the care he needs where I currently live so we needed to move him in with his brothers a few cities over. A few months ago, his health took a turn for the worst and is still rapidly declining.

My mom feels comfortable enough me all the shit he’s done now that I’m older and he’s living with his uncles. I’ve never heard my parents argue but she told me they did it all the time behind closed doors. He was very controlling and wouldn’t let her be around friends or family when they were married. I knew none of this was going on when I was a kid. The only thing she feels was true about my father was how much he loved me. He would take up all his sick hours and vacation days to spend time with me. He would hold me for hours and hours when I was crying. 

He used to be so funny, so wise, so caring, despite the fact that he would hit me. It wasn’t out of malice. That was the only way he knew how to discipline me. I developed anxiety disorder because of it later on. I don’t completely blame him for that, it’s a cycle of abuse he learned from his father. But with that and the abuse my mother suffered, it’s easy to hate him now. My image of him has been completely tainted and now I can’t so much as hold a conversation with him over text without nearly exploding with anger. I haven’t talked to him in weeks. I’m worried that this is just a phase and when he dies I’m going to regret not spending time with him.

443,How to make a major life decision (job opportunity)?,"My fiancée \[F42\] and I \[M38\] are uncertain how to make a decision on something that has come up.  Essentially, someone she knows has contacted her with a possibility of a job.  This job has a substantially higher pay than what she currently earns and she is not happy in her current job.

The first issue is that the job is on the other side of the country.  We currently live only hours (max) from all of my family and half of hers; if we move, we would only see them once or twice a year.  My current work is very specific to where we currently live, so I would be unemployed (her new wage would still be higher than our current combined income) until I can find a new field.  We would be leaving a city for a town with substantially lower population, so less job opportunities for me and this \*could\* be worse for our social lives.  That said, the location is supposed to be very beautiful and is a popular tourist destination (we had previously discussed travelling there ourselves).

The other major issue is that we have recently bought a house.  We are disinclined to sell the house at present and would not be able to rent it out until we have owned it for 12 months (legal reasons).  We have just barely begun some renovations too.

This is probably the perfect job, but neither the time nor the place we would have ideally wanted it.  If we take the opportunity, we leave people and our house behind; if we do not, a similar opportunity may never arise.  We have tried a pros/cons list (basically summarised in this post), but came no closer to a decision.  How should we go about deciding the what is best for us here?",1

Now I’m still getting over her. I think I’m just confused or something because I think I’m catching feelings for that guy. But I don’t know because I’m still dealing with my feelings for the girl who rejected me. The guy has a girlfriend and she’s is my close friend. So I’m kinda screwed. 

Me and the guy talk quit often and I hope I’m just confusing like between like like.

193,I don't know anymore.,"As I'm writing this, I'm in the verge of tears, trying not to get my mom to catch me crying because she'll surely tease me for it. 

I'm a cosplayer. I make my own attires and I'm involved in a few teams where we cosplay as characters from my favorite anime at the time, My Hero Academia. 

One of these teams is huge. And I've always felt like in a big family there but now I think I don't fit in anymore. They have both a spam and relevant stuff chats. I had to get out from spam since I couldn't handle many messages at the same time. 

Ever since I left there, even though I still share a lot with the guys from the team, I've felt like I'm far, far away. They always do meet-ups, they cosplay from other animes together, they make plans, and I'm never in them because I never know about them. 

A while ago, they proposed a Season 4 photoshoot and I was thrilled. I wrote to them that I wished to take part with my most recent cosplay, which was almost complete, but the character I wanted to be was taken. The leader was cool about it. She said smth like ""I'm sorry, honey, the character is already taken, and like I said more details will come along in the spam chat"". I felt appalled, deleted my messages and said it was fine. 

It's been like half an hour and I'm trying not to cry. I feel left out. Whenever I'm with them I feel good, but in occasions like these, I feel like I'm not really part of them. I feel like an alien, like an outcast.

What can I do?

577,Should I take job that originally rejected me?,"TLDR at bottom. 

A bit of background: I (23F) graduated with a BSBA a year early and got into my industry and decided quickly I didn’t care for it specifically so I spent a year in the outdoors industry which I loved. When my stint of seasonal work ended my boyfriend and I moved back to our home region and started looking for careers. 

I applied to probably 10 jobs and got interviews for only a few. One of them was a rigorous interview process for the local federal prison for a secretary position. They took 50 applications and interviewed 7 people. I thought I did really well but never heard back from the interviewers. I tried follow up calls and emails and never got responses. 

2.5 months later I just got a phone call from the interviewer that “the position will be reposted in the next few days and we’re highly encouraging you to reapply”. Which tells me a couple things: 

1) someone took the job and quit in under 2 months, 2 weeks of which are an off-site training 

2) I was the second or third choice for the job and therefore have a good chance of being offered the job 

This job pays about $10 more per hour than I’ve ever made and has really nice hours. But it’s in a pretty high security prison and thus a chance of being dangerous even as a secretary. 

This wouldn’t be a job I’d love but the salary would be really helpful. 


TLDR: a job that previously couldn’t even give an email to say I didn’t get the job wants me to reapply",1

433,"I have a friend that talks a lot, very loud, and very slowly.","TLDR at the bottom.

She rambles and exaggerates which is somewhat entertaining but it's usually more leaning towards wanting her to move on with the story.
Whether you're laughing along (politely or legitimately) or not she doesn't seem to understand that the story isn't as funny/interesting and is dragging on to someone who wasn't there. Sometimes it's even a second hand story that she's telling with an incredible amount of needless detail. She speaks VERY loud and incredibly slow, so much that you'll think she's stopped talking so you'll start to respond or start telling your own story, but then she'll continue.

I can wait for it to be over most of the time but sometimes it gets close to me wanting to just walk out of the room. I'll never do anything rude like actually walk out and close the door or put my fingers in my ears in front of her or anything of the sort. I cant even get myself to not at least giggle out of politeness.

Very occasionally I'll try something to appropriately hint that she can move on like I did tonight- ""Oh cool, yeah I understand.... yeah yeah I get it..... so what happened after that though??"" with an interested-in-the-story sort of tone. Sometimes she will finish the story in a more appropriate manner, but 99% of the time she'll get obviously a bit awkward or offended about it: ""Its not that I didnt think you understood, I just wanted to be sure I was explaining it well.... like I was just trying to explain that.."" and so continues the rambling about the same thing only with an awkward feeling and with me super unsure as to what expression I'm supposed to hold on my face or respond with when she's done. She doesn't get angry, she just seems a bit embarrassed and feels the need to defend herself. I absolutely HATE making people feel embarrassed; I think it's one of the worst feelings in the world.
There's also zero amount of her reading body language involved.

ONE time I asked her to lower her voice (quite wordily as I remember) and she said sorry and continued normally. We were in a loud-ish public standing area and so she was trying to super speak up and be very close (as you might normally would do in the situation), but kept on as I tried my best to inch away. When I said something and suggested we go sit down I couldn't even concentrate on what she was saying much anymore because I was trying to figure out what I must have said to make this time pan out better. Also, I'm sure I have to pick my battles. In public, I can feel other people hear how loud she is, but she could really (seem to) not care- which is awesome, but I'm just not like that.

I mean we all get carried away with our stories, lord knows I'm a rambler (hence this post) and sometimes tmi, but this is getting too much. I will also soon be spending a lot more time with her which I am very excited about, but as we're getting older we're finding ourselves in quite more sober settings where it bothers me quite a bit.
Shes actually incredibly smart, she's got a heart of gold, and she would do absolutely anything for her friends. I love her very much and do not want to offend her.

Is there anything I might be able to do?




TLDR: I have a close friend almost always tell stories like a loud drunk. The few times I've tried to nonchalantly put a stop to it she sees through my rouse and feels embarrassed, making things awkward and me feeling bad for having said anything.",1
66,Should I ask to be paid?,"Hi, Im Lore Im 21 and last week my parents went away for the whole week. A little backstory, I do not pay rent, I think its because Im autistic and unable to hold a good job, but I contribute to the household by helping with chores, errands and, buying dry cat food and cat litter for the house.
 I was left in charge of my two cousins (15 and 17) 3 dogs, 3 cats, and 5 chickens (cats and chickens are no big deal to take care of)
 I had to make sure that the kids were off to school in the morning and picked up afterwards, brought to driving school, cook dinner, keep the house tidy, give rides to my cousin if he wanted to see his friends or be picked up. I needed to make sure I went to work and my appointments too (which I ended up cancelling 2 of the 3) I also have my own pet-sitting on the side which I was able to take care of. I just found it odd my parents were willing to pay other people to come watch the kids and make sure everything is done as mentioned above because they would be going out of their way.

107,Move in with my parents save a lot of money or be independent?,"I currently live far away for school. I am graduating soon and need to figure out my next plan. My parents tell me to move with them where I can get free food, free housing, and basically not have to worry about anything. Just work and save money. 

Other choice is live on my own and be independent. I will be a registered nurse so decent money. I can Do whatever I want whenever I want. I am 28 years old will have a decent job. I know the smart thing to do financially is live with my parents. I can save so much money and live a comfort free lifestyle retire early. Or I can try to make it on my own here which is multiple states away. I tend to be frugal and the thought of just being able to save a lot of money and retire young would be great. However it comes at an expense. My parents are chill people, but when I think about how my life was back where I used to live it was really boring. The pro is that they live in a populated city and my income would be a lot higher there as opposed to living out where I live right now.

96,How do I choose between my current major in college and my passion?,"I'm in my second year in college majoring in mechanical engineering. I go to a university with a prestigious undergraduate engineering program, and it's becoming harder and harder to keep up a decent grade. I love my friends and my life outside coursework here, but it really takes a toll on my motivation when I spend so much time just for failing grades. I've endured it for over a year, but the thing that set me over the edge was a phone call I got from my parents after midterms last week went poorly.

They were obviously upset with my performance and gave me their usual lecture about spending more time on school, asking for help, etc. However, this time they asked something I didn't expect. 

""Are you going to be able to continue doing this?""

For context, my parents have always pushed me to be a high achiever, and they're most of the reason why I decided on going to my current university. I wasn't ever overly enthusiastic about engineering, but things like math and physics just came quickly to me in middle and high school. Unfortunately my talent ran out, and I feel depressed whenever I start doing my coursework for the day. My parents know that I struggle, but they're very invested in my current plan of study, both emotionally and financially. That's why this phone call shocked me; should I really continue doing what makes me so unhappy?

The only other thing I'd considered when applying to college was photography, videography, and film. I spent a lot of time later in high school with it, and I've come to pretty decent success to the point where I've taken senior pictures, videos for high school sports teams, and promos for local businesses/organizations. Even now in college I take on passion projects in my free time, making things like short edits for my favorite movies and videos hyping up our parties and functions on campus. It never seems the same as doing engineering work.

To be fair, things can definitely seem more dull when you're doing it as a job, not a passion. Who's to say I won't be just as unhappy pursuing photography and film? Engineering, at the very least, is a solid choice in life. It just really seems like this is the point in my life where I need to make a choice in my career path, and I'll only waste more time and money the longer I wait. What's your take on this?

TL;DR - I'm a struggling engineering student, but I've been more passionate about photography &amp; film. Do I make use of my progress so far and really focus in on my work, or do I pursue my interests and change my course of study?",1

We fit and being around him makes me feel not only happy but just safe and content. Even arguing is fun. Honestly regardless I wouldn’t do anything bc I value the friendship too much but I’m actually confused about whether I just really love and cherish my best friend or if there’s more. I’m a pretty cuddly person so wanting to hug and cuddle with him isn’t really a decisive indicator. The reason this came up is because I sprayed his scent on my teddy bear when he went back to his uni after a weekend visit. I couldn’t explain why I did this to my flat mate but the reason I did it is just because I hate not seeing him and being around him everyday. It’s always been like this so I kind of feel like it’s just an aspect of our relationship but my flat mate kind of looked at me funny and asked if I was sure we were just friends. We definitely are and I don’t think a relationship would work anyway because I don’t think he’s super sexual and I totally am, plus I have no idea where each of us are going to end up after uni and whether we’ll even be on the same continent. Nonetheless I don’t know if I could honestly say that if those factors changed and he felt the same way that I would still be opposed to anything. But is that just because I love the companionship and comfort of our friendship? I know he’d be an amazing life partner to any girl.

571,I hate living with my brothers,"We all live together in a house bought by our dad who rents it out to us for a really good rate.  Sounds amazing, right?  

Well some aspects are but for the most part as the older sister I am doing most of the chores and paying most of the bills while I put their share of the cost on an iou.  

This enormous iou is in the thousands of dollars for each of my two brothers and they do pay off some of it every few months but I don't know if or when they will ever pay it off in full.

Also, the house is as messy as your average student ghetto apartment and even though we have a chore schedule they usually only do a few chores every month while I try to do as many as I can but I can't manage to keep up with all the cleaning involved in an entire house.  

Also, we argue constantly over house issues, who gets to play music when, blah blah blah.  And as the cherry on top one brother is a food hoarder, although he will vehemently argue and gaslight about it until the end of time with any number of techniques.  

He takes up multiple different common areas with his food, stuffs the fridge door with his food so it's hard to open and close sometimes and makes his designated storage areas an eyesore of excessive food.  

And holidays almost always suck.  When we all have a stat holiday and we're cooped up in the same house together we inevitably get into heated arguments and I feel like I have to stand down and be a pushover or stand up for myself and have a shitty, upsetting Christmas. 

Half the time (I'd say exactly half) I do enjoy my brothers' company and we often socialize and try to get along but I feel like I might be happier living on my own with a house that is easier to clean.  

I'm really introverted but if I ever come out of my shell I'd like to have friends and dates over but at the moment I am ashamed of the appearance of my living space.

My main obstacle to moving out is that I don't make that much money and the rent is 3x more expensive if I move out.

Also I don't have any friends and I'm not very social so I think I would be lonely if I moved out and then my mind spirals to the thought that I will try to make friends for a bit, give up, retreat inward and then commit suicide.

I’m a kissless virgin so yea but I have had opportunities but I dismiss girls because I’m a misogynist. And most  girls treat me like shit despite the fact they need makeup to look attractive yet they have that ‘ewwww how dare you even look at me’ attitude on them if I do. I don’t leave the house except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. sometimes it’s ok but other times it’s very difficult. I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once. Also the there’s a guy who’s a higher up authority on my part  I work and he’s younger than me and all he does is stare at me like I have 3 heads and looks me down because I’m skinny. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(

404,I met a guy... now what,"I fell for him and he feels the same kinda

I’m a freshman in college, I met a boy who is slightly older than me (a junior) who I really like. I know he likes he as well as we’ve hung out and hooked up multiple times and he’s outwardly said he cares for me. 

We stopped hooking up for some reasons a couple weeks ago. We started up again a couple days ago and since then we’ve hung out three times with me spending the night once. The problem arises around here, I really fell for him and it’s at a point where if we were older we’d be in the beginning stages of a relationship. He vehemently doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want to be “tied down to one thing” and he wants to “keep his options open.”

At the very beginning of us talking it was almost completely sexual. We didn’t do anything with our clothes on and while we talked a lot it was mostly hooking up. I would only come over late at night and would leave within a couple hours.

After we began talking again I said that we had to make our intentions and plans clear. He said he didn’t want to be exclusive or in a relationship while he knows I did. A couple hours later he did say he would try being exclusive until he “absolutely can’t anymore” which I took to be a good sign of progress. I said that I wanted to see him in normal settings and actually be close with him.

It’s now changed to us hanging out during the day and just relaxing together with sexual stuff thrown in randomly. I thought everything was going really well and we were making progress into relationship territory. He’s said that I’m “kinda” his girl and just overall changed his demeanor towards me a lot. Tonight was no different, we had fun and did a lot of stuff. There were some good signs, but a lot of not so great ones.

448,I (18/M) live in an incredibly conservative house but want to experiment with myself,"I've been experimenting with what I like and what I dislike for a while, and I've come to the conclusion that I think I'm gay.

450,Emotional Dependent. Need Advice.,"I just need some advice concerning about this. I am 1st year college and I am an average person. 3 week had passed since my first day of school when a girl approached me which is my fellow classmate in my course, then she introduced herself to me. We have the same interests and often messaging each other on Facebook. Let's call her, Liza. We told each other secrets after a month passed like her suicidal tendencies which I keep to myself.

I seldom make any friends to any girl back then and also it's been a year when my ex-girlfriend broke to me. I am happy to make friends to a girl again, but this time it's not about romance or anything: I realized that I became emotionally dependent on Liza. For the past few days, I have been sulking to her for small things which I should not be bothered. When I also noticed that Liza is not replying to my messages although she already seen it, I feel empty afterwards and becoming bored. Perhaps, because I only have few people to share about my personal life and my secrets. I also became mad when she and my another friend which is a guy spent together drinking because of the guy's birthday celebration. I think to myself that I became mad because she didn't told me anything about that and kept it to herself. I also felt left out at that time. No, I don't love her, but I know I am dependent emotionally.

What should I do to stop being emotionally dependent to her?",1

237,"i volunteer in an international NGO and it's really toxic there, but i'm afraid to get out","The president of this NGO is really toxic. He would humiliate people when they make mistakes instead of encouraging good performance. He would give silent treatment to volunteers that he doesn't like and won't let people fix their mistakes. 

For example, 2 days ago, in a split second i made a decision to agree to a partnership with a company that has helped us a lot in the past 2 years. I was visiting the company building to see my old friend (i was not representing the NGO). And the head of PR department saw me, and we talked. He then asked me if they could be our sponsor again for next month's event so i said ""yeah sure why not. I'll give you the usual proposal"". I reported back to our whatsapp group about this sponsorship, and i was roasted for not consulting with him (the NGO president) first. I apologized for not asking him first, and in my defense, it was a really casual talk and as long as the proposal is not submitted to the company, it's not done deal. Today, i ask in the group again if they still want the sponsorship or nah, and he sarcastically replied ""oh, peraltasbitch i thought it was your decision to accept the sponsorship or not"" which doesn't help at all.

It's taking a toll on my mental health. I want to quit, but i met most of my best friends there and i actually believe in the cause that this NGO fights for. I've dedicated the past 3 years here and spend most of my time with these people and they're like a family to me. I kinda need to volunteer here as it's a pretty prestigious NGO and it would look good for when i apply for scholarship next year. One of the requirements to apply for the scholarship is to be active in local community. However, i'm sick of the NGO president and i just want to quit.",1

My name is Colin, and I'm currently in my third semester at an American University, studying business. I've been going through a lot, lately, and feel incredibly scared and alone. Using this post as a way to vent out my feelings, and maybe learn a thing or three from some of you.

**This post wound up being a LOT longer than I thought it would be, so I divided it up into sections, and put a TLDR at the bottom. No worries if you don't wanna read it all -- I totally get it!**

**POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING! MENTION OF MENTAL ILLNESS, ABUSIVE/TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS, AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. Please take care of yourself! &lt;3**

**Some background:** In high school, I *never* had to study. Ever. Academics came very naturally to me, and I got good grades. I was always a B+ kind of student, getting A's in the classes I was passionate about like history and English. Math and science have historically never been my cup of tea -- I get lost in the numbers a lot, and science always confused me, despite me finding it really interesting. I just kind of coasted along and got nice grades, and focused on the social aspects of that time of my life. I was never the most popular kid at my school but was rather well-liked. Everyone knew who I was, and generally had a favorable opinion of me. I always made a point of trying to be everyone's friend, having been bullied all through elementary and middle school, and I wanted to do the opposite of that. I was kind of a class clown in my day, but in a tasteful manner, I guess? Never disrespecting teachers or classmates, just kinda making witty remarks and pushing the envelope so to speak. I became well-known for the presentations I gave in my classes -- I would always take full advantage of presentation-based assignments and really exercise my creative liberties and do crazy stuff -- basically stand-up comedy routines that met the assignment requirements. The primary focus was always to entertain, while still delivering the information needed to succeed. When I gave my senior speech, people came from other classes to listen and watch me deliver it -- the floor was covered in people sitting on the ground who wanted to listen. The room was packed, and it made me feel so special. I wound up being nominated for Mr. (the name of my high school), and winning, despite not really being from any particular clique or playing any sports. I  had a pretty high opinion of myself. I had a girlfriend who I thought was pretty cool at the time, got into my top choice for University, and was really excited to head into the next chapter of my life. I felt good about myself. Life was fun. I was happy.  


**Freshman year:** College really soured a lot of the best parts of my life, and has left me feeling really down. That awesome girlfriend I mentioned earlier? We wound up going to the same university, which really excited me! However, things got extremely toxic very quickly. She was a lot like me, having been bullied a lot growing up, and wanted to be a positive force in people's lives, without succumbing to pressures to ""fit in"" arbitrarily. College presented both of us with a fresh start, however, and she decided she wanted to change. I supported her through it all, because growth is a huge part of life, and things seemed great. 

She started hanging around people who didn't really like me. At all. I'm an outgoing personality, to be sure, and I've always tried to make people happy and be as helpful as I can, and they found me irritating. They thought I was weird and cringy and lame, so-to-speak, and actively encouraged my then-girlfriend to do things without me. Seeing her opportunity to fit in with a crowd she had always quietly wanted to be a part of in high school, she started pushing me away. She'd insist that she loved me, but bully me and criticize aspects of my personality that she used to tell me were the reasons she fell for me in the first place. I was desperate to hold onto her, as we had been dating for three years at that point, and so I suppressed major aspects of my personality to try and appease the new her, and her new friends. 

It seemed to work for a while -- but I was miserable. I had given up my outgoing nature, my sense of humor, and my constant willingness to help others, the things that made me who I am, in order to fit in with people who didn't like me, all because of this girl who I thought did. She'd say awful things to me, but I felt that I deserved them. I felt like I really had just been annoying to people all my life, and started to resent my personality. I started to hate who I was. This went on through all of my freshman year, and made it really difficult for me. When summer came, I hardly recognized her anymore, and hardly knew who I was anymore. She had changed so much, and wanted nothing to do with me anymore, and broke up with me. I was lost. I had given up the things I loved about life and about myself in order to fit in with her and her friends, and ultimately lost sight of who I was. 

That toxic relationship rewired my brain in an awful way, and left me really hurt. I had struggled with serious mental health issues as I grappled with it last year. I grew depressed and attempted to take my own life once. If not for my roommate calling poison control, I would have died in my dorm last February. Through all of that, I was berated and made to feel that what I was going through was because I was weak. I never opened up to my parents about what I was going through, as they do not believe in mental illness. (Very much so of the mind that people struggling with depression are just feeling sorry for themselves and need to get over it.) I struggled academically, barely managing to stay enrolled in school here. I failed a few classes and had generally lackluster performance. My sleep schedule spiraled out of control. I was skipping meals and lost weight. I drank until I'd black out on weekends, only to cry in my room. Outside of my roommate, I felt completely and utterly alone.

**Summer:** Over the summer I tried to remove myself from anything that was unhealthy or hurting my mental health. I cut alcohol out of my life entirely and started going to my local gym, working hard to eat three meals a day. I made the weight I had lost back and actually put on some muscle. I felt pretty good about myself most days. My freshman year roommate invited me to live with him sophomore year in a house off-campus  with him and a few of our mutual friends, people who didn't like my ex-girlfriend because of how awfully she treated me, and who liked me, even though I had a lot going on. It was a pretty good summer -- I made time to see my friends from high school as much as I possibly could, and it was great. I felt more like myself again every single day, but something still didn't feel right. I didn't feel quite like myself and I couldn't explain why. I felt anxious in times where previously I would have been confident -- I wasn't outgoing anymore. I was afraid of making jokes. I strayed away from taking any sort of initiative amongst my friends.

**Sophomore Year (The Present):** I came into this new academic year with a Costco family value pack of issues because of how much of a mess my freshman year was. I came in this term with a 2.0 GPA -- just barely enough to avoid academic suspension and be kicked out of school for a year. College is significantly harder academically, and I wasted my chance to learn how to study and struggle through that safely last year. If I fail a single class, I'm going to be suspended for a year. I'm struggling to get good grades now, though doing better than I was for all of my freshman year -- I just worry constantly that it won't be enough. I'm trying my absolute hardest, trying my absolute best to study as much as I possibly can and get my work done on time and to the best of my ability. However, I keep missing deadlines or not doing as well as I'd like in my classes. I've missed classes several times because of oversleeping or just... apathy.

Outside of the house where I live now, I have next to no friends and feel incredibly alone. Even among my housemates, I feel like the oddball. I feel like they are a lot closer to one another than they are / ever will be to me. I try to do cool/funny things to fit in or ""earn my place"" with them, but feel like I'm just annoying. I feel like a liability to them. I just feel alone constantly, like no one wants to be my friend.  I have no hobbies anymore, and whenever I'm doing anything fun, deep down I'm resenting the fact that I'm not working. When I'm awake, I'm either working on stuff for my classes or on the internet. I've lost all consistency with the gym, struggling instead to just keep my GPA afloat so I can stay here.

I don't even know if I *like* business either -- I feel like I'm only studying it because my parents would disown me if I majored in anything else. I'm not good at math or science so I can't go into anything medical, and I lack the smarts to pursue law, even though deep down I think that'd be awesome. I'd much rather study education and become a high school teacher, or do something that makes a tangible impact on the lives of other people. Or just, some job where I can make people happy by talking to them and presenting things to them. Making them laugh. I just want to make people happy, and I feel like if I continue down this route, I'll end up an accountant, lol. (No shame in being an accountant! Just not necessarily lined up with what I want for myself, I guess, haha)

I just want to have a work/life balance again, and not be locked in an endless existential crisis about even *being here.* I wanna join a club, or learn rock guitar, or start a Youtube channel. Just s*omething.*

I feel like I'm watching my life fall apart before my eyes, and am powerless to stop it from happening. I feel like deep down, I deserve everything bad that is happening to me. That my ex and all of her friends are right about me. I feel like I'm wasting my youth, and what are supposed to be the best years of my life. I feel alone, as I'm afraid of the wrath of my parents. 

**TLDR:** I used to be really outgoing and happy, but due to a toxic relationship and serious mental health issues, I'm at an all-time low. I'm struggling academically, have an awful sleep schedule, am unsure if I even like my major, and don't really have many friends. I guess I just want to feel less alone and to have people to talk to or play video games with, and to feel like myself again.",1
82,I’m being harassed,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I’ll keep this short. 

Someone has got ahold of a compromising photo of me. This is a photo that was taken years ago, and I don’t know how he keeps finding me despite me changing my number and my details. This has been happening for months on telegram only. I did a tineye search of the photos and it returned no results. Meaning this is someone I likely know but don’t know who. 

I think it’s worth mentioning that these photos were likely sent during a depressive spiral where I just wanted validation. Meaning, I don’t know who the fuck I sent it to. One kind of has my face but not really, and the other photo is just to my jaw, so I’m not too concerned. 

I’m scared as hell, because every few weeks/months I get creepy ass telegram messages from him. He’s threatened to leak it multiple times online but it’s never happened. I don’t know how he’s keeping tabs on me. But I feel so anxious over this. 

I’ve also launched a police report but due to the fucking incompetence of them, they don’t really care. And I kinda got shamed. Also the nature of telegram makes it hard to track. So I’m really just. At a loss. And I don’t think I can go to my parents about this because I don’t even know where to begin about something like this. And I don’t want to open that can of worms.

457,My family is immigrating to US. I'm a senior college student in Taiwan. I need help.,"I don't know what you guys call it, but in my country it's called ""the Amarican dream"". I'm living in Vietnam, has been studying college in Taiwan, this is the last 8 month of my senior year.  Some of my uncle and aunty escaped Vietnam and lived in American since 1975. Now they guaranteeing their slibings ( my family ) to come to America get an US citizenship.
To give you some context, people in my country (Vietnam), like 90% of them want to leave the country, immigrating to another country, especially the US. They've been trying all possible way to get in the US country, including faking marriage, spending tons of money,... Still cannot have the chance. Most of my slibings already in US. Now it's my family's turn to interview for the green card. Legally and secured.

I'm currently a final year college student in Taiwan, Mingchuan University, with the speed of the profile processing, I don't think I'll have the chance to finish study before the green card expired. So It's either finish school and miss the chance to come to the US with my family (probably no second chance according to my parent and other slibings currently in the US) , or take the chance, and give up all the effort I made in school until now.

Is the US really the land of hope and dream ? Is there a chance for a ordinary college drop-out student to success over there ? I don't have any specialty and no talent in any field whatsoever. 

I'll list the cons for each desision ( as I can think of right now):
If I stay and finish study, I'll be away from my parent, they don't know English, they're not good with technology, they don't know the world or see the news, they only know that by risking the life they having now, they can provide me with a brighter future. I don't know how much will I made compare to others that choose to work in the US. Is there really a future for me in Taiwan or Vietnam.
If I choose to go, I don't know the life there, the job opportunities, the living cost,... I'll lose my girlfriend, we've been together for 6 years, and she really don't want me to go, we don't want me to keep receiving help from my father. I'll have no friends. I'll be sad, possibly depress, and if I'm not able to succeed and live my life as an ordinary labour there, the relationship between me and my family won't be the same.

I'm really sad and depress now. This thing have been pulling me down for nearly half a year. I need you guy's opinion and advise.",1
231,"Help me confront my roommate who constantly talks poorly about me behind my back and complains about things i do behind my back, yet acts completely fake and nice to my face.","Please help me word this concisely. She is my college roommate and we are living in an apartment with two doubles with 4 girls. I share a room with her. She acts really nice to me to my face, engages in and starts conversation and I don’t want to be rude back and ignore her or act passive aggressively so i respond kindly. I consider myself to be a friendly person, and I feel like i’m holding myself back from going off on her every time she is nice to me because i always want to be kind back. She is one of those crazy white girls that are very one-sided and can be irrational and can pick the victim card, so i need a concise, respectful yet direct and confrontational way of telling her i’m fed up with her bullshit and that i know that she is speaking shit behind my back and i can’t deal with fake energy.

3,[UPDATE] I (F18) told my best friend’s (F18) boyfriend (M18) that she’s been cheating on him with another guy (M23),"He knows everything now and there’s been a pretty major bust up over it. 😬

You guys were right though. It had to be done. I may have lost my best friend forever but at least my conscience is clear and her poor (ex-)boyfriend is no longer in the dark. He’s very appreciative that I told him but he’s pretty shaken up by it all, especially after the nasty fight that ensued when he dumped her. He truly looks like a man who has lost everything. I told him I’m here for him if he wants to talk about it.

I mean, right now part of me feels like I’ve made things worse for everyone but I know that’s only in the short term. It was best to rip the band aid off ASAP. The sting will pass.

I want to thank you guys for all your advice!",1

741,I just dont understand.," So this has been eating at me all weekend and I am hoping by regurgitating it here I may feel somewhat better.

For context, the friend I am about to speak about has been over to my place many times in the past and every time she has managed to bully me into doing lines of coke with her.

Last Wednesday I saw her at our local pub and she asked if she could come around on Fri night.  
Without thinking much about it I said yes.

Then on Thursday morning I thought I would be clear with her that she is welcome to come over, but I do not want to do anything as I promised to help a friend move on Saturday morning.

She got really annoyed with me as asked if our friendship was that ""black &amp; white"". Which is a comment I do not understand. Have I done the wrong thing by saying no, I do not want to do that on Fri night?

So roll around Friday and late afternoon I get a message from her saying she is unwell and wont make it out that night.  
I asked if it was to do with our conversation on Thursday and she said No. So I wished her well and carried on with my night.

A few hours later I walked past the pub and she was sitting there drinking away....

So all weekend now it has been eating at me.

Did I do the wrong thing by not wanting to write myself off on friday night?  
Why did she feel the need to lie to me about being unwell on the Friday night?

Ok rant over, hopefully, one day this situation will make sense to me. I feel like I've lost a really good friend who I love and adore. But for reasons which I just do not understand. :(",1

726,Wife (34f) whose husband (35m) told her she isn’t attractive to him at all and resents her inability to find employment around his schedule.,"My husband and I have been married for 11 years. I was a size 0 for most of the early parts of our marriage. We had a daughter and I lost the weight immediately after-followed by another baby who I kept some of the weight from but not more than 15 pounds. As I’ve gotten into my 30’s I am now 130 pounds and 5’2. 

My husband has a job where we move a lot. He often is gone for weeks at a time on business trips or overnight trips with only a few days warning. We have moved away from family (all more than a days drive away 12+ hours) because of the job placements. 
I have always been supportive of my husband throughout his career. I make an effort to never keep him home if he has a day he can go golf or just unwind. 

We have two daughters whom we love more than anything. I am very involved in their schooling, volunteering and being the sole parent available for daily pick ups and dropping them off, sick days, or different breaks for the seasons. This makes it extremely difficult to find employment that can cater to my restricted availability. Resentment has now grown to be the elephant in the room because I cannot contribute financially. I try to alleviate money stressors by being thrifty shopping,  not going out, I don’t ask for expensive items or buy new things for myself (or our children) without talking about it with him first.  

Is there a job I can do that could work with my crazy schedule? I have a high school diploma and have completed some college (Associates Degree). 

It’s absolutely devastating to me knowing my husband feels this way about me. We haven’t been intimate in any way for months and it kills me knowing now that he has thought me unattractive for so long. Another part of me is mad because I don’t have a perfect body but I’m still within normal weight for my size. My BMI is in the healthy range and I wear a size 4 in pants. 
I wake up and shower, apply makeup, and get dressed nicely as an attempt to keep myself from letting go. 

I’ve begun to diet again and work out but I just keep hearing his words in my head. I wake up so sad and heartbroken I don’t know if I can continue on without any physical touch (other than a daily peck or two) for the foreseeable future until I’m attractive to him again physically or he feels I’m contributing financially.  

Another part doesn’t want his dam approval on my body and I worry I can’t be with him physically no matter my weight or shape because I’ll know I’m a milkshake away from being unattractive to him again..

Please be kind. I’m lower than I’ve ever been and need an outsiders opinion. I don’t want a divorce. I love my husband. I just want to know what others may think because I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this.",1

My girlfriend was over and saw me doing this and thought it was the weirdest thing in the world. Do people do this, or am I just weird?",1
