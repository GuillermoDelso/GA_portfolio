# Project 3: Natural Language Processing and web scraping

This project was provided by General Assembly to its' DSI-9 students in 2019.

### Overview:

**The saying goes like this: "(There's) no such thing as a stupid question (only a stupid answer)"** 

The Boston Institute of Linguistics (BIL) wants to obtain hard evidence on the extent to which this saying is true. While the underlying goal of this saying is to support the quest for knowledge (by getting rid of the fear to look 'unknowledgeable' for asking questions), the BIL believes that there might be some linguistic truth in this saying. 

They want us to analyze whether there is much difference between the questions that obtain serious responses, and those that obtain 'bad-responses'. 

The BIL has asked us to look for 'subreddits' where the answers given to potentially normal questions are bad responses, and to compare them to the questions from another subreddit where the questions receive good/normal responses. 

The subreddits chosen:

> /r/Advice

> /r/shittyadvice

We will contribute to BIL's study by responding the following questions:
- To what extent can we differentiate whether a post is from the r/Advice subreddit or from the r/shittysubreddit, by only looking at the post titles? 
- How can we improve our predictions?
